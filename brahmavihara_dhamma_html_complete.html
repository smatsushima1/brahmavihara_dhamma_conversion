</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Venerable 
          Mahasi Sayadaw of Burma</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>A Biographical 
          Sketch</b></font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The late Venerable 
          Mahasi Sayadaw was born in the year 1904 at Seikkhun, a large, prosperous 
          and charming village lying about seven miles to the west of the historic 
          Shwebo town in Upper Burma. His parents, peasant proprietors by occupation, 
          were U Kan Taw and Daw Oke. At the age of six he was sent to receive 
          his early monastic eduction under U Adicca, presiding monk of Pyinmana 
          Monastery at Seikkhun. Six years later, he was initiated into the monastic 
          Order as a novice (samanera) under the same teacher and given the name 
          of Shin Sobhana (which means Auspicious). The name befitted his courageous 
          features and his dignified behaviour. He was a bright pupil, making 
          remarkably quick progress in his scriptural studies. When U Adicca left 
          the Order, Shin Sobhana continued his studies under Sayadaw U Parama 
          of Thugyi-kyaung Monastery, Ingyintaw-taik. At the age of nineteen he 
          had to decide whether to continue in the Order and devote the rest of 
          his life to the service of the Buddha Sasana or to return to lay life. 
          Shin Sobhana knew where his heart lay and unhesitatingly chose the first 
          course. He was ordained as a Bhikkhu on the 26th of November 1923, Sumedha 
          Sayadaw Ashin Nimmala acting as his preceptor. Within four years Ven. 
          Sobhana passed all three grades of the Pali scriptural examinations 
          conducted by the Government.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ven. Sobhana next 
          went to the city of Mandalay, noted for its pre-eminence in Buddhist 
          learning, to pursue advanced study of the scriptures under Sayadaws 
          well-known for their learning. His stay at Khinmakan-west Monastery 
          for this purpose was, however, cut short after little more than a year 
          when he was called to Moulmein. The head of the Taik-kyaung monastery 
          in Taungwainggale (who came from the same village as Ven. Sobhana) wanted 
          him to assist with the teaching of his pupils. While teaching at Taungwainggale, 
          Ven. Sobhana went on with his own studies of the scriptures, being especially 
          interested in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta. His deepening interest in 
          the satipatthana method of vipassana meditation took him next to neighbouring 
          Thaton where the well-known Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw was teaching it. 
          Under the Mingun Jetavan Sayadaw’s instruction, Ven. Sobhana took 
          up intensive practice of vipassana meditation. Within four months he 
          had such good results that he could teach it properly to his first three 
          disciples at Seikkhun while he was on a visit there in 1938. After his 
          return from Thaton to Taungwainggale (owing to the grave illness and 
          subsequent death of the aged Taik-kyaung Sayadaw) to resume his teaching 
          work and to take charge of the monastery, Ven. Sobhana sat for and passed 
          with distinction the Government-held Dhammacariya (Teacher of the Dhamma) 
          examination in June 1941.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the eve of the 
          Japanese invasion of Burma, Ven. Sobhana had to leave Taungwainggale 
          and return to his native Seikkhun. This was a welcome opportunity for 
          him to devote himself wholeheartedly to his own practice of satipatthana 
          vipassana meditation and to teaching it to a growing number of disciples. 
          The Mahasi Monastery at Seikkhun (whence he became known as Mahasi Sayadaw) 
          fortunately remained free from the horror and disruption of war. During 
          this period the Sayadaw’s disciples prevailed upon him to write 
          the ‘Manual of Vipassana Meditation’, an authoritative and 
          comprehensive work expounding both the doctrinal and practical aspects 
          of satipatthana meditation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was not long 
          before the Mahasi Sayadaw’s reputation as a skilled meditation 
          teacher had spread throughout the Shwebo-Sagaing region and came to 
          the attention of a devout and wealthy Buddhist, Sir U Thwin. U Thwin 
          wanted to promote the Buddha Sasana by setting up a meditation centre 
          directed by a teacher of proven virtue and ability. After listening 
          to a discourse on vipassana given by the Sayadaw and observing his serene 
          and noble demeanour, Sir U Thwin had no difficulty in deciding that 
          the Mahasi Sayadaw was the meditation teacher he had been looking for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the 13th of November 
          1947, the Buddhasasana Nuggaha Association was founded at Rangoon with 
          Sir U Thwin as its first President, and with scriptural learning and 
          the practice of the Dhamma as its object. Sir U Thwin donated to the 
          Association a plot of land in Hermitage Road, Rangoon, measuring over 
          five acres, for the erection of the proposed meditation centre. In 1978, 
          the Centre occupied an area of 19.6 acres, on which a vast complex of 
          buildings and other structures had been built. Sir U Thwin told the 
          Association that he had found a reliable meditation teacher and proposed 
          that the then Prime Minister of Burma invite Mahasi Sayadaw to the Centre.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the Second 
          World War, the Sayadaw alternated his residence between his native Seikkhun 
          and Taungwainggale in Moulmein. Meanwhile, Burma had regained independence 
          on 4th January 1948. In May 1949, during one of his sojourns at Seikkhun, 
          the Sayadaw completed a new <i>nissaya</i> translation of the Mahasatipatthana 
          Sutta. This work excels the average nissaya translation of this Sutta, 
          which is very important for those who wish to practise vipassana meditation 
          but need guidance.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In November of that 
          year, on the personal invitation of the then Prime Minister, U Nu, Mahasi 
          Sayadaw came down from Shwebo and Sagaing to the Sasana Yeiktha (Meditation 
          Centre) at Rangoon, accompanied by two senior Sayadaws. Thus began Mahasi 
          Sayadaw’s guardianship of the Sasana Yeiktha at Rangoon. On 4th 
          December 1949 Mahasi Sayadaw personally instructed the very first batch 
          of twenty-five meditators in the practice of vipassana. As the meditators 
          grew in numbers, it became too demanding for the Sayadaw to give the 
          entire initiation talk to all the meditators. From July 1951 the tape-recorded 
          talk was played for each new batch of meditators with a brief introduction 
          by the Sayadaw. Within a few years of the establishment of the Sasana 
          Yeiktha at Rangoon, similar meditation centres were inaugurated in many 
          parts of the country with Mahasi-trained members of the Sangha as meditation 
          teachers. These centres were not confined to Burma alone, but extended 
          to neighbouring Theravada countries like Thailand and Sri Lanka. There 
          were also a few centres in Cambodia and India. According to a 1972 census, 
          the total number of meditators trained at all these centres (both in 
          Burma and abroad) had exceeded seven hundred thousand. In recognition 
          of his distinguished scholarship and spiritual attainments, Mahasi Sayadaw 
          was honoured in 1952 by the then Prime Minister of the Union of Burma 
          with the prestigious title of Aggamahapandita (the Exalted Wise One).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Soon after attaining 
          Independence, the Government of Burma began plans to hold a Sixth Buddhist 
          Council (Sangayana) in Burma, with four other Theravada Buddhist countries 
          (Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos) participating. For this purpose 
          the Government dispatched a mission to Thailand and Cambodia, composed 
          of Nyaungyan Sayadaw, Mahasi Sayadaw and two laymen. The mission discussed 
          the plan with the Primates of the Buddhist Sangha of those two countries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the historic 
          Sixth Buddhist Council, which was inaugurated with every pomp and ceremony 
          on 17th May 1954, Mahasi Sayadaw played an eminent role, undertaking 
          the exacting and onerous tasks of Osana (Final Editor) and Pucchaka 
          (Questioner). A unique feature of this Council was the editing of the 
          commentaries (Atthakatha) and sub-commentaries (tikas), as well as the 
          canonical texts. In the editing of this commentarial literature, Mahasi 
          Sayadaw was responsible for making a critical analysis, sound interpretation 
          and skilful reconciliation of several crucial and divergent passages.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A significant result 
          of the Sixth Buddhist Council was the revival of interest in Theravada 
          Buddhism among Mahayana Buddhists. In 1955, while the Council was in 
          progress, twelve Japanese monks and a Japanese laywoman arrived in Burma 
          to study Theravada Buddhism. The monks were initiated into the Theravada 
          Buddhist Sangha as novices while the laywoman was made a Buddhist nun. 
          Then, in July 1957, at the instance of the Buddhist Association of Moji, 
          the Buddha Sasana Council of Burma sent a Theravada Buddhist mission 
          to Japan. Mahasi Sayadaw was one of the leading representatives of the 
          Burmese Sangha in that mission.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also in 1957, Mahasi 
          Sayadaw undertook the task of writing an introduction in Pali to the 
          Visuddhimagga Atthakatha, to refute certain mis-statements about its 
          famous author, Ven. Buddhaghosa. The Sayadaw completed this difficult 
          task in 1960, his work bearing every mark of distinctive learning and 
          depth of understanding. By then the Sayadaw had also completed two volumes 
          (out of four) of his Burmese translation of this famous commentary and 
          classic work on Buddhist meditation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the request of 
          the Government of Sri Lanka, a special mission headed by Sayadaw U Sujata, 
          an eminent deputy of Mahasi Sayadaw, went there in July 1955 to promote 
          satipatthana meditation. The mission stayed in Sri Lanka for over a 
          year doing admirable work, setting up twelve permanent and seventeen 
          temporary meditation centres. Following the completion of a meditation 
          centre on a site granted by the Sri Lankan Government, a larger mission 
          led by Mahasi Sayadaw left Burma for Sri Lanka on 6th January 1959, 
          via India. The mission was in India for about three weeks, during which 
          its members visited several holy places associated with the life and 
          work of Lord Buddha. They also gave religious talks on suitable occasions 
          and had interviews with Prime Minister Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, President 
          of India Dr. Rajendra Prasad and vice-president Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. 
          A notable feature of the visit was the warm welcome received from members 
          of the depressed classes, who had embraced Buddhism under the guidance 
          of their late leader Dr. Ambedkar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The mission flew 
          from Madras to Sri Lanka on 29th January 1959 and arrived at Colombo 
          on the same day. On Sunday 1st February, at the opening ceremony of 
          the meditation centre named ‘Bhavana Majjhathana’, Mahasi 
          Sayadaw delivered an address in Pali after Prime Minister Bandaranayake 
          and some others had spoken. The members of the mission next went on 
          an extended tour of the island, visiting several meditation centres 
          where Mahasi Sayadaw gave discourses on vipassana meditation. They also 
          worshipped at famous sites of Buddhist pilgrimage like Polonnaruwa, 
          Anuradhapura and Kandy. This historic visit of the Burmese mission under 
          the inspiring leadership of Mahasi Sayadaw was symbolic of the ancient 
          and close ties of friendship between these two Theravada Buddhist countries. 
          Its benefit to the Buddhist movement in Sri Lanka was a revival of interest 
          in meditation, which seemed to have declined.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In February 1954, 
          a visitor to the Sasana Yeiktha might have noticed a young Chinese man 
          practising vipassana meditation. The meditator in question was a Buddhist 
          teacher from Indonesia by the name of Bung An who had become interested 
          in vipassana meditation. Under the guidance of Mahasi Sayadaw and Sayadaw 
          U Ñanuttara, Mr Bung An made such excellent progress that in 
          little more than a month Mahasi Sayadaw gave him a detailed talk on 
          the progress of insight. Later he was ordained a bhikkhu and named Ven. 
          Jinarakkhita, with Mahasi Sayadaw as his preceptor. After he returned 
          as a Buddhist monk to Indonesia, the Buddha Sasana Council received 
          a request to send a Burmese Buddhist monk to promote missionary work 
          in Indonesia. It was decided that Mahasi Sayadaw, as the preceptor and 
          mentor of Ashin Jinarakkhita, should go. With thirteen other Theravada 
          monks, Mahasi Sayadaw undertook such primary missionary activities as 
          consecrating simas (ordination boundaries), ordaining bhikkhus, initiating 
          novices and giving discourses, particularly talks on vipassana meditation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Considering these 
          fruitful activities in promoting Buddhism in Indonesia and Sri Lanka, 
          we might describe Mahasi Sayadaw’s missions to these countries 
          as ‘Dhamma-vijaya’ (victory of the Dhamma) journeys.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As early as 1952, 
          at the request of the Thai Minister for Sangha Affairs, Mahasi Sayadaw 
          had sent Sayadaws U Asabha and U Indavamsa to Thailand for the promotion 
          of satipatthana vipassana. Thanks to their efforts, Mahasi Sayadaw’s 
          method gained wide acceptance in Thailand. By 1960, many meditation 
          centres had been established and the number of Mahasi meditators exceeded 
          a hundred thousand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It was characteristic 
          of the Venerable Sayadaw’s disinterested and single-minded devotion 
          to the cause of the Buddha Sasana that, regardless of his advancing 
          age and feeble health, he undertook three more missions to the West 
          (Britain, Europe and America) and to India and Nepal in the three years 
          (1979, 1980 and 1981) preceding his death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Abhidhajamaharatthaguru 
          Masoeyein Sayadaw, who presided over the Sanghanayaka Executive Board 
          at the Sixth Buddhist Council, urged Mahasi Sayadaw to teach two commentaries 
          to the Sangha at Sasana Yeiktha. Ven. Buddhaghosa’s Visuddhimagga 
          Atthakatha and Ven. Dhammapala’s Visuddhimagga Mahatika deal primarily 
          with Buddhist meditation theory and practice, though they also offer 
          useful explanations of important doctrinal points, so they are vital 
          for prospective meditation teachers. Mahasi Sayadaw began teaching these 
          two works on 2nd February 1961, for one and a half or two hours daily. 
          Based on the lecture notes taken by his pupils, the Sayadaw started 
          writing a nissaya translation of the Visuddhimagga Mahatika, completing 
          it on 4th February 1966. This nissaya was an exceptional achievement. 
          The section on the different views held by other religions (samayantara) 
          was most exacting since the Sayadaw had to familiarise himself with 
          ancient Hindu philosophy and terminology by studying all available references, 
          including works in Sanskrit and English.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Up till now Mahasi 
          Sayadaw has to his credit 67 volumes of Burmese Buddhist literature. 
          Space does not permit us to list them all here, but a complete up-to-date 
          list of them is appended to the Sayadaw’s latest publication, namely, 
          ‘A Discourse on Sakkapanha Sutta’ (published in October 1978).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At one time, Mahasi 
          Sayadaw was severely criticised in certain quarters for his advocacy 
          of the allegedly unorthodox method of noting the rising and falling 
          of the abdomen in vipassana meditation. It was mistakenly assumed that 
          this method was an innovation of the Sayadaw’s, whereas the truth 
          is that it had been approved several years before Mahasi Sayadaw adopted 
          it, by no less an authority than the mula (original) Mingun Jetavan 
          Sayadaw, and that it is in no way contrary to the Buddha’s teaching 
          on the subject. The reason for Mahasi Sayadaw’s preference for 
          this method is that the average meditator finds it easier to note this 
          manifestation of the element of motion (vayodhatu). It is not, however, 
          imposed on all who come to practise at any of the Mahasi meditation 
          centres. One may, if one likes, practise anapanasati. Mahasi Sayadaw 
          himself refrained from joining issue with his critics on this point, 
          but two learned Sayadaws brought out a book each in defence of the Sayadaw’s 
          method, thus enabling those who are interested in the controversy to 
          judge for themselves. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This controversy 
          arose in Sri Lanka where some members of the Sangha, inexperienced and 
          unknowledgeable in practical meditation, publicly assailed Mahasi Sayadaw’s 
          method in newspapers and journals. Since this criticism was voiced in 
          the English language with world-wide coverage, silence could no longer 
          be maintained and so Sayadaw U Ñanuttara of Kaba-aye (World Peace 
          Pagoda campus) forcefully responded to the criticisms in the pages of 
          the Sri Lankan Buddhist periodical ‘World Buddhism’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Mahasi Sayadaw’s 
          international reputation has attracted numerous visitors and meditators 
          from abroad, some seeking enlightenment for their religious problems 
          and others intent on practising meditation under the Sayadaw’s 
          personal guidance. Among the first meditators from abroad was former 
          British Rear-Admiral E.H. Shattock who came on leave from Singapore 
          and practised meditation at the Sasana Yeiktha in 1952. On his return 
          to England he published a book entitled ‘An Experiment in Mindfulness’ 
          in which he related his experiences in generally appreciative terms. 
          Another foreigner was Mr. Robert Duvo, a French-born American from California. 
          He came and practised meditation at the Centre first as a lay meditator 
          and later as a bhikkhu. He subsequently published a book in France about 
          his experiences and the satipatthana vipassana method. Particular mention 
          should be made of Anagarika Shri Munindra of Buddha Gaya in India, who 
          became a close disciple of Mahasi Sayadaw, spending several years with 
          the Sayadaw learning the Buddhist scriptures and practising vipassana. 
          Afterwards he directed an international meditation centre at Buddha 
          Gaya where many people from the West came to practise meditation. Among 
          these meditators was a young American, Joseph Goldstein, who has written 
          a perceptive book on insight meditation titled ‘The Experience 
          of Insight: A Natural Unfolding’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some of the Sayadaw’s 
          works have been published abroad, such as ‘The Satipatthana Vipassana 
          Meditation’ and ‘Practical Insight Meditation’ by the 
          Unity Press, San Francisco, California, USA, and ‘The Progress 
          of Insight’ by the Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, Sri Lanka. 
          Selfless and able assistance was rendered by U Pe Thin (now deceased) 
          and Myanaung U Tin in the Sayadaw’s dealings with his visitors 
          and meditators from abroad and in the translation into English of some 
          of Sayadaw’s discourses on vipassana meditation. Both of them were 
          accomplished meditators.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Venerable Mahasi 
          Sayadaw is profoundly revered by countless grateful disciples in Burma 
          and abroad. Although it was the earnest wish of his devoted disciples 
          that the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw might live for several more years 
          and continue showering the blessings of the Buddhadhamma on all those 
          in search freedom and deliverance, the inexorable law of impermanence 
          terminated, with tragic suddenness, his selfless and dedicated life 
          on the 14th of August 1982. Like a true son of the Buddha, he lived 
          valiantly, spreading the word of the Master throughout the world and 
          helped many thousands and tens of thousands onto the Path of Enlightenment 
          and Deliverance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This "Brahmavihara 
          Dhamma" (Divine Abidings) expounded by the late Venerable Mahasi 
          Sayadaw, reveals the systematic method of developing <i>Metta, </i>loving-kindness 
          towards all beings and the way to lead a life of holiness. The style 
          of presentation and the informative materials contained therein stand 
          witness to the depth and wealth of spiritual and scriptural knowledge 
          of the eminent author. The warmth and sympathetic understanding of the 
          human nature with which the author is moved, reflects the noble qualities 
          of a true disciple of the Buddha who was committed to the welfare of 
          all living beings. And who had throughout his lifetime from the time 
          of His Supreme Enlightenment, devoted his compassionate skill to the 
          aid of others for their emancipation from woes, worries and sufferings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A careful reading 
          of this Dhamma or teachings, followed by an unfailing practice of meditation 
          that has been clearly presented in this text will, I believe, amount 
          to storing a fortune in the shape of happiness in the present lifetime 
          as well as higher spiritual attainment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddhism, as a world 
          religion, has proven to be a guiding force to human civilisation and 
          to all mankind who are in misery. Life, in fact, is full of sufferings, 
          and what is seemingly pleasurable is in reality miserable. It was only 
          after the appearance of Buddhism, which inculcates moral discipline, 
          and <i>metta, </i>loving-kindness that the people will find a happier 
          and peaceful world. The way to cultivate <i>metta </i>and compassion 
          <i>(karuna) </i>has been vividly shown in this Brahmavihara Dhamma apart 
          from other finer qualities, which a human being should possess and practise 
          for the sake of one's own benefit and of other sentient beings. Full 
          instructions are given in this text of Dhamma to develop the noble practices 
          particularly the four Brahmavihara, namely, <i>metta, karuna, mudita 
          </i>and <i>upekkha </i>according to what has been taught by the Buddha 
          in a subtle and profound way with Great Compassion flowing freely towards 
          all living creatures. Buddha could see how all beings are suffering 
          and bearing the burden of their <i>khandhas </i>for so long as they 
          are drifting along in the tide of <i>samsara.</i> The Dhamma has taught 
          us to have also <i>(karuna) </i>compassion, for others in distress including 
          animals from minute ones to enormous creatures. This has been elucidated 
          by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw to enable us to clear away the dust 
          in our eyes to discern the truth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This text of Dhamma 
          is enriched with a number of anecdotes which go to illustrate with lucidity 
          the value of developing loving-kindness, compassion and rejoicing in 
          others' prosperity and happiness, and also how to control anger, avoid 
          envy, practise patience and self-reliance and other virtues. It has 
          been emphasised that human life is vulnerable to pain and suffering. 
          Life is a process of change from the simple to the complex, birth to 
          death, from beginning to end. Nothing ever remains the same in a man, 
          which is composed of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>which are arising and 
          vanishing at every moment of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, contacting 
          and imagining. The appearance and disappearance of vibrating manifestations 
          are the becoming and cessation process of <i>rupa-nama, </i>which are 
          transient by nature. This fact of "impermanence" brings in 
          its wake discomfort; pain, illness and unhappiness as also what is erroneously 
          considered as joy and pleasure, which are in fact, <i>sukha-vedana. 
          </i>Preaching has been made that a person who is not disciplined in 
          morality will lack wisdom, and in consequence, even a trivial evil committed 
          by him will lead him to the state of misery. Buddha has taught us to 
          pave our own way for salvation, i.e., to practice nobly and diligently 
          to get rid of all miseries. Buddha could only teach us the way to happiness. 
          "Purity and impurity depend on oneself, no one can purify another", 
          says the Buddha. This brings us to the law of <i>kamma. </i>We are the 
          heirs of our own <i>kamma, </i>good and bad actions of what we have 
          done in the past and what we are doing now. In the matter of developing 
          <i>karuna </i>(compassion) towards a being who is suffering, and in 
          extreme misery beyond succour, one will have to nurse a feeling of equanimity 
          - <i>upekkha.</i> In essence, it is to view the fate of that being as 
          <i>"kammassaka" </i>i.e., every living being has only <i>kamma 
          </i>as his own personal property in possession. Good <i>kamma </i>produces 
          good and bad <i>kamma </i>produces evil, e.g., "generosity" 
          yields wealth; "morality" causes one to be reborn in noble 
          families in states of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">happiness; 
          "anger" causes ugliness, and so on. These have been shown 
          citing relevant stories, which are authentic as </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">taught 
          by the Buddha.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Rare indeed is this 
          Dhamma which has been so elaborately expounded by the author, the Venerable 
          Mahasi </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Sayadaw 
          that our heartfelt gratitude goes to the Sayadaw and also to U Thein 
          Han, a retired Judge and a </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Executive 
          Member of the Buddha Sasana Nuggaha Organisation, for making tape recordings 
          of this noble Dhamma preached by the Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw. These 
          recordings were transcribed and the manuscript was presented to the 
          Sayadaw for scrutiny, rewritings and approval before the final draft 
          went to the press.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Life has been described 
          as a continuous becoming <i>(bhava) </i>like a wheel moving on and on 
          upon the wilderness of samsara. One is born, one grows and suffers, 
          and eventually dies to be reborn and continues the endless journey called 
          <i>'bhava' - life </i>existence. Buddha has pointed out that insight 
          knowledge, called wisdom can be gained only by way of achieving <i>sila, 
          samadhi </i>and <i>panna </i>(morality, concentration and wisdom) through 
          the Noble Eightfold Path. Wisdom, therefore, constitutes the great accomplishment 
          for an aspirant. One who aspires should know the true characteristics 
          of <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>anatta 
          </i>(impermanence, suffering or unsatisfactoriness, and not-self) through 
          serious contemplation on and noting, which will finally lead towards 
          complete liberation from sufferings after attainment of <i>magga-phala-nana 
          </i>(path and fruition knowledges).<i> </i>The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw 
          has given us guidelines to achieve that insight wisdom by the practice 
          of vipassana even while developing <i>metta, karuna, </i>etc. Impermanence 
          of all things are evident. When we are young, we are only vaguely aware 
          of these things. It is because of lack of wisdom that health and vigour 
          act as barriers against the onslaughts of life. With the passage of 
          time as we grow older with grey hairs and other signs of decay, we come 
          to see what is actually happening to us in true perspective, and the 
          significance of the ceaseless change occurring in us and things around 
          us. Buddha's teaching is as vital and relevant today as it was when 
          he lived centuries ago.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I have translated 
          this wonderful Dhamma with as much scholarly accuracy as possibly, and 
          with my humble spiritual perceptiveness that is within my practical 
          knowledge of the Dhamma which I have been able to acquire under the 
          guidance of my spiritual teachers. May this work contribute towards 
          a wider knowledge of the Dhamma and a deeper appreciation of Buddhism, 
          which is highly pragmatic. May the constant practice of the Dhamma on 
          the lines indicated in this text prevent <i>akusala </i>(unwholesome 
          states of mind) and ultimately destroy all the fetters that keep us 
          away from our final goal, Nibbana.</font></p>

<font size="3">Prelude to the Dhamma</font></font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Today is the Full Moon day of Waso, 1327 
          B.E., Starting from today, I will give teachings on the Brahmavihara 
          Dhamma. In the phrase or group of words - "Brahmavihara", 
          the word "Brahma" means "Noble". This word, if properly 
          pronounced in Pali should be recited as "Birahma". In Burmese, 
          it is to be represented and recited carrying a vocal sound as "Brahma". 
          This can be easily understood. The word "Vihara" conveys the 
          meaning of "Dwelling", or "Abiding", or "Living". 
          Hence, " Brahmavihara " purports the meaning of "Noble 
          Living", or rather, "Living in the exercise of goodwill."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The expression "Brahmavihara", 
          if analysed, will include <i>metta, </i>friendliness or loving-kindness, 
          <i>karuna, </i>compassion, <i>mudita, </i>goodwill or rejoicing with 
          others in their happiness or prosperity, and <i>upekkha, </i>equanimity 
          or indifference to pain and pleasure. These are the four kinds of <i>Brahmavihara. 
          </i>It has however been mentioned in Mahagovinda Sutta as <i>"Brahmacariya." 
          </i>Therefore, Brahmavihara Dhamma is commonly named as <i>"Brahmacara" 
          </i>Dhamma. <i>Brahmacariya </i>means Life of Holiness or Living a Virtuous 
          Life. This can therefore be also called <i>Brahmacara Dhamma </i>from 
          now onwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Then also, in the Abhidhamma <i>desana</i>, 
          the Brahmavihara Dhamma has been explained as <i>appamanna, </i>the 
          term that is derived from the word "infinite" or "boundless". 
          It has been so named as <i>appamanna </i>because when developing <i>metta, 
          </i>loving-kindness, it could be done with unlimited or perfect exercise 
          of the qualities of friendliness - <i>metta </i>etc., towards all beings.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Arial" size="-1">Analytical statement of the meaning 
          of metta</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Of the four kinds of Brahmavihara Dhamma, 
          <i>metta </i>means love, <i>karuna </i>means compassion, <i>mudita </i>means 
          happiness or joy, <i>upekkha </i>means equanimity. Out of these four 
          meanings translated into English, only the meaning of the word 'compassion' 
          is clear and precise without mingling with any other sense or terminology. 
          The term "love" may convey the sense of clinging or attachment 
          with <i>raga, </i>human passionate desires. "Happiness" also 
          concerns rejoicing for fulfillment of one's own desire or, in connection 
          with Dhamma. "Equanimity or Indifference" covers various aspects 
          of mental sensations, etc. As such, if the meanings of the terms: <i> 
          metta, mudita and upekkha </i>are rendered in English as love, happiness 
          and equanimity, it would appear to have related to other meanings of 
          different shades, extraneous to what is really intended to convey. Hence, 
          it would be more obvious, if they are expressed in ordinary Pali usage, 
          as <i>metta bhavana,karuna bhavana, </i>and <i>upekkha bhavana. </i> 
          So we shall use the Pali language, which is more comprehensively clear 
          to delivering this teaching.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Metta bhavana</i> means nothing but 
          to develop one's mind with loving-kindness towards others. When a thought 
          occurs wishing prosperity and happiness to others, it is but a virtuous 
          thought. What is meant by <i>karuna bhavana</i> is to develop compassionate 
          feeling towards other beings. Even ordinarily, if one feels pity towards 
          the other wishing him escape from sufferings, it is a virtuous thought 
          of <i>karuna</i>. As regards <i>"mudita", </i>it conveys the 
          sense of joy or rejoicing with others in their continued happiness and 
          prosperity. Regarding the term <i>upekkha, </i>it is a feeling of indifference 
          or equanimity with no interest or worry in another's happiness, state 
          or condition - having a neutral sensation - thinking that these things 
          have inevitably happened according to <i>kamma, </i>the consequential 
          effects of good or bad merits. Of these four sorts of <i>brahmavihara, 
          </i>first and foremost, I shall deal with the development of <i>metta 
          brahmavihara.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the Visuddhi 
          Magga (The Path of Purification - a text on meditation), before explaining 
          the manner as to how contemplation should be made on <i>pathavi kasina,</i> 
          (the earth kasina)<i>, </i>the subject of preliminary arrangements <i>(parikamma) 
          </i>to be done, has been elaborated quite exhaustively. To put it in 
          a nutshell as to what is most essential, priority should be given to 
          the proper observance of morality, the purity of <i>sila, </i>and then 
          to completely settle anything to be done which may cause hindrances 
          <i>(palibodha) </i>or create a feeling of worry in regard to the residing 
          monastery. The next point is to accept with faith and confidence the 
          instructions given relating to the method of developing lovingkindness 
          <i>(metta), </i>which one intends to take up from a competent meditation 
          teacher (<i>kammatthanacariya). </i>This is the method I am now going 
          to prescribe. It is necessary to stay in an appropriate monastery, or 
          rather, a retreat centre, and settle all anxieties likely to creep in, 
          such as, shaving the head and cutting off the hairs on the head and 
          clipping the finger and toe nails and carrying out other trivial matters. 
          Later, take a rest for a while after meals to avoid sluggishness or 
          inertia. Only after finishing up all odd jobs that need to be performed, 
          choose a quiet spot or a place of solitude, and then take up a sitting 
          posture with ease and comfort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Sitting with ease and comfort means to 
          obtain a comfortable way of sitting so that one can sit for a long time 
          without interfering with his or her contemplation. To begin training, 
          the best way is to sit erect cross-legged so as to become comfortable. 
          There are three kinds of sitting postures. (1) The manner of sitting 
          posture found in Buddha images or statues. This is not very easy for 
          the Burmese people to imitate. (2) The way bhikkhunis or nuns used to 
          sit without interlocking the legs, is not suitable. This position is 
          generally adopted by many. It is to keep the legs parallel while sitting 
          without pressing one against the other. It may be feasible since, the 
          posture will not block the blood flow running through the veins. (3) 
          The sitting posture adopted by bhikkhunis, which is best, i.e., the 
          sitting posture with half the length of the legs crossed. Any one of 
          these three types of sitting postures, best suited to you, may be chosen. 
          Females also may sit as they please. The manner of taking a sitting 
          posture as stated, is required only at the primary stage of meditation. 
          Thereafter, sitting postures with knees up or with legs stretched, may 
          be taken up according to circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Meditation can be done while walking, 
          or standing, or sitting, or lying down, which are the four usual postures. 
          It is clearly evident that meditation exercise can be made by adopting 
          any one of the four postures as stated in the Metta Sutta in the following 
          words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Tittham caram nisinno va, sayano 
            yavatassa vigatamiddho etam satim adhittheyya."</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The meaning of this Pali phrase is:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Tittham </i>- either in the act of 
          standing, <i>caram</i> - or in the act of walking, <i>nisinno va - </i>or<i>
</i>while sitting, <i>sayano</i> - or while lying down, <i>yavata - 
          </i>for the duration of that period, <i>vigatamiddho - the </i>mind 
          will be free from sloth or sleepiness, <i>assa - </i>and<i> </i>it will 
          so happen. <i>Yavata - </i>for that particular length, of time, <i>etam 
          satim -</i> this practice of mindfulness which arises along with loving-kindness, 
          <i>adhittheyya -</i> should be developed by fixing the mind upon it 
          and letting oneself remain in this state of mind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It has been clearly instructed to contemplate 
          and note by way of assuming the four usual postures not only in respect 
          of <i>metta bhavana, </i>but also in regard to practising <i>satipatthana 
          vipassana </i>relating to which it has been preached as <i>gacchanto 
          va gacchamiti pajanati </i>",etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Hence, although instructions have been 
          given to take up a sitting posture cross-legged at the initial stage 
          of meditation, all of the four <i>iriyapathas </i>or postures can be 
          adopted as may be considered appropriate in developing <i>metta bhavana, 
          </i>i.e., meditation to cultivate mindfulness on loving kindness. The 
          essential point is to develop contemplation on loving-kindness on all 
          occasions or rather continuously, leaving aside about four hours at 
          the time of midnight or six hours time for sleep. When going to bed 
          at about 9 or 10 p.m. while lying in bed before falling asleep, it should 
          be so developed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">After taking up the cross-legged posture, 
          the faults of anger or malice and the advantages of patience should 
          be imagined and reflected upon. If these have been already reflected 
          upon earlier, it would be quite sufficient. This has been accordingly 
          instructed in as much as benefits will be accrued by reflection. It 
          is not extremely important though. If meditated with intense faith and 
          enthusiasm, beneficial results would be derived. Nonetheless, if one 
          is going to undertake any kind of work or business, there may be things 
          which are to be reflected upon or fulfilled. Rejection can be made only 
          when one sees the fault. For example, take the case of a person sweeping 
          and cleaning a room in a house or a monastery, with a broomstick. He 
          would pick up and throw away scraps of paper, cloth or broken pieces 
          of stick if they are considered by him as mere trash or worthless stuff 
          to be discarded. If such trash or waste matter are kept or put aside 
          in this or that place inside the room, the room cannot possibly be free 
          from rubbish. In the same way, if the fault of anger is not perceived, 
          one is likely to accept that 'anger' without rejecting it. There is 
          every possibility that such a state of affairs or condition would prevail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"> For instance, n</font><font face="Arial" size="-1">owadays 
          people who bear grudge against someone or have grievance against others 
          for having done something wrong to their detriment, may be said to have 
          been harbouring the anger or malice. An aggrieved person who has so 
          become angry, may feel bad or sour even if others would appease his 
          anger by comforting him with nice words. And then, he might even consider 
          it pleasurable to entertain this blooming anger, or even become infuriated 
          or flared up when someone tries to sober him down. Moreover, it is likely 
          that he would even blame others for bossing him. This resembles a person 
          who keeps a venomous viper in his pouch tucked up at his waist accepting 
          the anger not realising the disastrous consequence or the fault of it. 
          Hence, to be able to reject the anger, one should reflect upon the faulty 
          nature of this anger or the spiteful feeling. The manner of reflection 
          to be done according to the texts of Dhamma, has been shown as follows: 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">At one time, on being asked by a 
          wandering ascetic, Paribbajako, by the name of Channa, as: "For 
          what kind of fault that is inherent or apparent in <i>raga, dosa </i>and 
          <i>moha, </i>has it been preached and prescribed for rejection, or rather, 
          to get rid of them?", the Venerable Ashin Ananda Thera gave the 
          reply as stated hereinafter.</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="3">The Fault of Anger</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Avuso</i> - O, my friend Channa, <i>duttho 
          - </i>a vicious person who is bearing ill-will or becoming angry, <i>dosena 
          abhibuto </i>- being overwhelmed with anger, nay, overpowered by anger 
          or resentment, <i>pariyadanam citto -</i> which has used up or wiped 
          off all noble-mindedness or virtuous thoughts, nay, without goodwill 
          because of anger, <i>attavyapadayapi ceteti - </i>plot<i> </i>to cruelly 
          cause himself to suffer misery; <i>paravyapadayapi . . . ubhayavyapadayapi 
          ceteti </i>- carry out plans to ill-treat himself as well as others, 
          and bring about miserable conditions. <i>Kayena - </i>physically<i>, 
          duccaritam </i>- bad deeds, such as killing, etc., <i>carati - </i>are<i>
</i>committed; <i>vacara - </i>verbally<i> </i>(and) <i>manasa - </i>mentally<i>, 
          duccaritam -- </i>utter abusive words, wishing others' ruin or destruction 
          in life and property and so on. In essence, it is to reflect and exercise 
          restraint based upon this Dhamma so preached. The manner of reflection 
          and exercising restraint or keeping one's mind under control is:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When giving rise to aggressive anger, 
          it is obvious that one becomes miserable. Feeling of joy or happiness 
          which previously pervades him immediately disappears. Mental distress 
          takes place which then changes his looks to become grim and distorted 
          caused by unhappiness. He would become fidgety, and the more he becomes 
          furious, the more he is distressed and embarrassed both physically and 
          mentally. Anger may incite him to commit murder or utter obscene words. 
          If he makes a retrospection of his past evil deeds, he<i> </i>will, 
          in the least, feel sorry and humiliated by being conscious of his own 
          guilt; or that, if he has committed a crime, he will definitely suffer 
          all at once in receiving due punishment for his crimes. Furthermore, 
          in his next existence he can descend to the <i>apaya </i>realm where 
          he will invariably have to undergo immense suffering and misery. This 
          is just a brief description of how anger will bring about dire consequences. 
          Such incidents can be personally experienced and known by mere retrospection.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Misery caused to others by anger is more 
          obvious. In the least, making others feel unhappy by word of mouth is 
          fairly common. A person who is railed at may feel awfully distressed 
          and suffer mental pain. Angry mood may relegate to the level of killing 
          others or causing severe suffering mentally. Even if no terrible consequence 
          may not take place in the present lifetime, an angry person will land 
          in the nether world esin his future existences. If at all he is reborn 
          in the world of human beings by virtue of his wholesome <i>kusala kamma, 
          </i>he will be greatly handicapped with a short span of life, exuberant 
          diseases and ugliness in his personal appearance. Anger cut both ways 
          endangering both the person who is angry and the aggrieved. I would 
          not propose to illustrate further citing relevant stories relating to 
          the manner of reflection on the faults of anger since there is hardly 
          any time at my disposal to tender my teachings on how <i>metta </i>can 
          be developed.</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2"> <font size="3">(8) </font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">The 
          Beneficial Fruits of Patience</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Next, in the matter of reflecting on the 
          merits or fruits of 'patience', <i>khanti. </i>Patience or forbearance 
          is basically the Dhamma contrary to anger, which, in other <i>words, 
          </i>is <i>adosa - </i>absence<i> </i>of anger. It is similar to the 
          essence of <i>metta, </i>loving-kindness. In particular, what is said 
          to have patience, is to be able to endure any kind of provocation and 
          to remain calm without anger and doing evil. <i>Metta </i>or loving-kindness 
          is more significant or rather, far-reaching in meaning than patience. 
          It imbibes the quality of goodwill, rejoicing with other people's happiness. 
          The advantages of patience have been described in the Visuddhi Magga 
          (The Path of Purification) in the manner stated below.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>'Khanti paramam tapo titikkha" 
            </i>which means "Patience is the highest or best devotion". 
            It is the noblest and pious practice of virtue.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>'Khantibalam balanikam". </i>It 
          connotes that since patience has its own strength, it should be understood 
          as preached by the Buddha that the beneficial fruits of patience by 
          symbolising the attributes of a noble person <i>- brahmana, </i>have 
          the force of strength which is but patience. What is actually meant 
          by this Dhamma is that the strength or vigour of patience capable of 
          preventing anger resembles a force of army which is able to defeat the 
          enemy. Buddha has therefore preached that a person who is equipped with 
          this strength of patience is a Brahmana, a Noble One.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Sadatthaparama attha, khantra 
            bhiyyo na vijjati." </font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The gist of this Pali phrase is that of 
          all the advantages, one's own benefits or interests, is the noblest. 
          Among the best </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">advantages, nothing 
          excels the beneficial results of forbearance or endurance. The advantages 
          of patience should </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">be realised as 
          had been stated by the King of Devas - Sakka, cited above.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">As stated in the foregoing Desanas, patience 
          is the noblest and the best practice. It is most noble and admirable 
          because one who has patience will be able to tolerate all criticisms 
          or irritating remarks which would ordinarily incite retort or refutation; 
          and by virtue of this noble attribute, he will earn respect and approbation 
          from others. He will also receive help and assistance when occasion 
          arises and can bring about closer intimacy between himself and other 
          friends. Nobody would hate him. These advantages or benefits are quite 
          conspicuous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If retaliation is made against any verbal 
          attacks, hot controversy will ensue between the two parties and quarrel 
          will break out. Feeling of hatred and animosity will creep in and the 
          parties may become antagonistic to one another with malice and also 
          become enemies for life. If no tolerance or patience is practised, one 
          will be inclined to cause harm to another, maybe, throughout the entire 
          lifetime. If, however, patience is cherished or nursed, it would bring 
          about a world of advantages. This can be clearly known by retrospection. 
          Hence, the Exalted One had prescribed in the form of <i>Patimokkha, 
          </i>the Code of Conduct for monks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It has been preached as: <i>"khanti 
          paramam tapo titikkha nibbanam paramam vadanti Buddha", </i>etc. 
          This has been mentioned earlier. <i>Nibbanam - </i>the<i> </i>most Noble 
          and Virtuous. It was taught as such by the Lord Buddha simply because<b>
</b>all practices for the derivation of merits can be carried out successfully 
          only if there is patience. When donation is offered on a magnificent 
          scale with the greatest generosity, it shall be performed with great 
          patience. In practising <i>sila, </i>moral precepts, spirit of tolerance 
          required to be borne by a person becomes more prominent. In practising 
          and developing meditation, i.e., <i>bhavana, </i>it becomes predominant. 
          All bodily sufferings and miserable conditions will have to be tolerated, 
          and only by contemplating and noting with patience, concentration and 
          wisdom or knowledge can be gained. If changes in the bodily postures 
          are frequently made on account of minor discomforts, such as, stiffness, 
          hotness and pain, it will be difficult to enhance one's own power of 
          concentration - s<i>amadhi. </i>This will make it harder to achieve 
          <i>vipassana </i>insight knowledge. Only when one contemplates and notes 
          with patience and endurance, <i>jhana</i> <i>samadhi</i> can be attained. 
          Then only, special knowledge of vipassana or the higher awakening consciousness 
          of the Dhamma along with <i>magga-phala-nana</i>, i.e., Knowledge of 
          the path and fruition, can be realised. As such, it may be stated that 
          patience is the noblest and highest practice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A wise old saying, "Patience will 
          carry one to Nibbana" is most appropriate. In practising for the 
          fulfilment of ten forms of <i>paramitas</i>, or ten perfections, it 
          can be fully achieved if <i>khanti</i> or patience is applied. Among 
          these <i>paramittas</i>, determination, exertion and knowledge (<i>panna</i>) 
          are proximate to the attainment of Nibbana. Only if relentless and persistent 
          effort is made as originally intended to reach Nibbana with a firm determination, 
          vipassana knowledge and <i>ariya-magga-nana</i> will be fully accomplished. 
          If so diligently practised with patience arahatship will be attained. 
          Such an arahat is said to be a noble Brahmana who is fully endowed with 
          the strength of patience. That is what Buddha has said. It is indeed 
          a noble practice which can lead to Nibbana. When developing metta, practice 
          of patience is essentially fundamental. Only in the absence of anger, 
          and by practising patience, mindfulness and metta will become developed. 
          This is the reason why it has been instructed to reflect upon the advantages 
          of patience prior to developing loving-kindness or <i>metta</i>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="1"> <font size="2"> <font size="3">(9)</font>
</font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">The Manner Of Developing Metta</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It is stated that metta should be developed 
          in order to make the mind free from the ills of anger by reflecting 
          upon its faults or evils as well as upon the advantages of patience 
          so as to conjoin patience by letting it run parallel. One way of developing 
          <i>metta</i> is to gain perfection, i.e., <i>paramita</i>, and also 
          merit. Another way is to develop <i>metta </i>for the attainment of 
          <i>jhana samadhi. </i>There are two kinds as just stated. Visuddhi Magga 
          has analytically and distinguishably commented upon in explaining the 
          method of developing <i>metta </i>for the achievement of <i>jhana samadhi, 
          </i>as to who should be omitted at the initial stage of developing and 
          transmitting <i>metta, </i>and who should be entirely excluded in developing 
          loving-kindness. As time does not permit at present (today) to explain 
          the difference in their distinctive features, I am inclined to speak 
          about the manner of developing <i>metta </i>for the purpose of gaining 
          perfection and merit, first and foremost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In the matter of <i>metta bhavana, </i>developing 
          <i>metta </i>through meditation, it can be exercised and developed by 
          contemplation, dwelling the mind on all human beings or other sentient 
          beings (living beings) who may be seen or heard, or who may appear in 
          the mind's eye. The manner of developing with a feeling of benevolence 
          as stated in Suttanta Pali and Atthakatha, which say, 'May one gain 
          happiness, or May all be happy and healthy, i.e. <i>Sukhita hontu, </i>or 
          <i>Sabbe satta bhavantu sukhitatta. </i>'May all beings be pleased and 
          happy. Briefly put, goodwill should be imparted in the following way 
          "May all be blessed with happiness"<font size="1"> (To be 
          repeated twice)</font>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Therefore, whether one is residing in 
          his own quarters or whether one is moving about or working, if a person 
          or any living being is seen or heard, loving-kindness should be developed 
          with a sincere and sympathetic feeling as "May he find happiness! 
          May he find happiness!". In the same manner, it is to put the spirit 
          of loving-kindness in the bottom of your heart mentally, saying, 'May 
          all beings be happy", in case a large gathering of people or a 
          number of other beings are seen or heard. This is quite an easy and 
          excellent way of radiating <i>metta </i>since every being wishes to 
          be happy. This method of developing loving-kindness is <i>metta manokam, 
          </i>the noblest feeling springing from the mind. At the moment when 
          monks and laity are worshipping and paying homage to the Lord Buddha, 
          they used to develop loving-kindness by uttering <i>Sabbe satta avera 
          hontu, </i>etc., i.e., "May all beings be free from all dangers." 
          It is called <i>"metta vacikam" </i>as this feeling of metta 
          is expressed by word of mouth. If the words "May all be happy" 
          are uttered verbally, it is also "<i>metta</i> <i>vacikam".</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In this regard, besides developing metta, 
          mentally and verbally, special care should be taken to also render physical 
          assistance to others, whenever possible, so as to make them feel happy. 
          On the other hand, it would be meaningless in fostering loving-kindness, 
          if one causes misery to others either physically, or verbally, or mentally. 
          It is therefore essential to do good to others, and by doing so, the 
          act of developing mindfulness on loving-kindness, may be said to be 
          genuinely effective. For instance, while loving-kindness is radiated 
          from his heart to a person who is coming face to face with him in a 
          narrow lane wishing him happiness, it would also be necessary to give 
          way to him, if he is worthy of respect. Such a behaviour would then 
          amount to honouring him with a virtuous thought and would be in consonance 
          with one's own inner feeling of <i>metta</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">He who develops loving-kindness to others, 
          while travelling, would be required to make room for other fellow travellers 
          who may be looking for accommodation in the same carriage, provided 
          of course, there is available space. He should assist others as far 
          as possible if he happens to find them overburdened with a heavy load. 
          In connection with business affairs, it amounts to exercising loving-kindness<i> 
          (metta) </i>by instructing another person in matters with which he is 
          not acquainted. Speak gently and sweetly, and accord a warm reception 
          with a fine gesture and a smiling sweet face. Help a person to the best 
          of one's own ability. These are the genuine manifestations of goodwill 
          and loving-kindness. To speak with a sweet voice is <i>metta vacikam. 
          </i>Giving physical help to others is <i>metta kayakam.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">What has been stated in the Patisambhida 
          Magga Pali that 528 kinds of <i>metta </i>are developed, refers to the 
          manner of developing <i>metta </i>by those who have achieved <i>metta 
          jhana. </i>At the present time, however, it is usual to develop <i>metta, 
          </i>as a binding duty by monks, to do the recitation for the achievement 
          of <i>paramita </i>and <i>kusala. </i>The Pali dictum usually chanted 
          is the same as the recitation done by rote by the majority of the people. 
          I would first of all recite the dictum in Pali for the purpose of elucidation 
          and enumeration.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Sabbe satta, sabbe pana, sabbe bhuta, 
          sabbe puggala, sabbe attabhavapariyapana. </i>Up<i> </i>to this, these 
          five phrases denote all sentient beings without distinction and limitation. 
          Hence, the expressions: <i>sabbe satta - </i>all<i> </i>creatures, <i>sabbe 
          pana</i> - all those beings who breathe, <i>sabbe bhuta - </i>all<i>
</i>living beings, <i>sabbe puggala - </i>all<i> </i>those individuals 
          or persons, and <i>sabbe attabhavapariyapana - </i>all<i> </i>those 
          individuals or persons who have the attributes of a being or <i>khandha, 
          </i>convey the same meaning. Each and every expression mentioned above, 
          refers to all beings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Then comes: <i>sabba itthiyo, </i>all 
          females; <i>sabbe purisa, </i>all males; <i>sabbe ariya </i>all<i> </i>Noble 
          Ones; <i>sabbe anariya, </i>all those <i>puthujjana </i>or ordinary 
          worldlings; <i>sabbe deva, </i>all those devas or celestial beings;. 
          <i>sabbe manusa, </i>all those human beings; <i>sabbe vinipatika, </i>all 
          those beings belonging to the four <i>apayas. </i>These expressions 
          denote the different types of seven species of beings, namely, a pair 
          of males and females, a pair of <i>ariyas</i>, Worthy Ones, and worldlings 
          (<i>puthujjana), </i>and three groups of beings, viz: Devas, human beings 
          and beings belonging to <i>apayas. </i>Loving-kindness that is developed 
          radiating towards the seven groups severally and individually identifying 
          them in their respective different identities is known as <i>odhisa 
          metta. </i>The first five phrases earlier stated having no limitations 
          with reference to all beings, is called <i>anodhisa metta, </i>which 
          means <i>metta </i>without any distinction and limit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In developing <i>metta, </i>these two 
          groups forming twelve (12) aphorisms should be recited or uttered in 
          combination with the four phrases, viz: <i>Avera hontu </i>- May escape 
          from all dangers; <i>avyapajjha hontu </i>- May be free from mental 
          distress or suffering; <i>anigha hontu </i>- May be free from bodily 
          suffering or injury; <i>sukhi attanam pariharantu - </i>May have the 
          full accomplishment with complete happiness, or rather, be able to happily 
          shoulder one's own bodily-self. The last dictum conveying goodwill: 
          "May have the full accomplishment with complete happiness and be 
          able to shoulder one's own bodily self or <i>khandha" </i>is<i>
</i>very significant and meaningful. All beings are prone and exposed 
          to external dangers of all sorts. There are also dangers of diseases 
          and sufferings <i>- dukkha vedanas - </i>in<i> </i>the material body 
          itself. Moreover, for the sake of one's own good health and proper livelihood, 
          everything possible should invariably be done and achieved. Only when 
          free from danger and harm that may befall a man, and when necessities 
          of life are adequately obtained, then happiness will be derived both 
          physically and mentally. If the burden of <i>khandha </i>can be successfully 
          shouldered, it can be said to be satisfactory from the point of worldly 
          affairs. That is the reason why development of <i>metta </i>should be 
          seriously made with a benevolent frame of mind by uttering the words. 
          "May one be able to shoulder and sustain one's own bodily-self 
          -<i>khandha, </i>with happiness."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If <i>metta is </i>developed saying, <i>sabbe 
          satta avera hontu: </i>May all beings be free from danger and harm, 
          etc., which comprise 5 phrases of <i>anodhisa (metta) </i>combined with 
          four (4) kinds of developing <i>metta, </i>it will come to (5 x 4) = 
          20. This is <i>anodhisa metta, </i>twenty in number. Next, if further 
          development of <i>metta is </i>practised, uttering, <i>"sabba itthiyo" 
          - </i>all<i> </i>females, etc., comprising 7 phrases of <i>odhisa (metta) 
          </i>along with the expression of sentiment - "May all be free from 
          danger, etc.", which describe the manner of developing <i>metta 
          </i>in 4 phrases, it comes to (7 x 4) = 28. This is <i>odhisa metta, 
          </i>twenty-eight in number. If added with 20 <i>anodhisa metta, </i>it 
          will come to a total of 48. This mode of developing <i>metta bhavana 
          </i>without direction-wise as to the region of the earth is called <i>disa 
          anodhisa metta.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Similarly, developing <i>metta </i>towards 
          all beings living in the East - <i>puratthimaya disaya, </i>as: <i>sabbe 
          satta avera hontu, </i>i.e., "May all beings be free from danger 
          and harm, etc.", would make up a sum of 48. In the same way, the 
          rest of the cardinal points of compass indicating direction of the regions 
          by the magnetic needle, viz; the West (48) in number, the North (48) 
          in number, the South (48) in number, with the addition of the four <i>anudisas 
          </i>or <i>vidisas </i>viz: the South-east (48), the North-west (48), 
          the North-east (48), the South-west (48), and also together with the 
          two, namely, <i>hetthimaya disaya </i>(48) and <i>uparimaya disaya </i>(48), 
          the Nadir and Zenith - (all six) when added up with the ten disas (regions) 
          each having 48, will amount to a total of forty-eight multiplied by 
          ten (48 x 10) = 480. This being the way of developing <i>metta </i>region-wise 
          of the Universe according to what is indicated by the compass needle, 
          is known as <i>disa odhisa metta. </i>If this 480 is added to 48 of 
          <i>disa</i> <i>anodhisa </i>it will reach the total figure of 528 kinds 
          of <i>metta</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In order to have an idea of the numerical 
          units of the 528 kinds of <i>metta; </i>let us develop loving-kindness 
          by reciting as follows,</font></p>
<ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">1. May all beings be free from danger, 
            from mental distress (misery), from bodily suffering, and be able 
            to shoulder the burden of one's own <i>khandha </i>with both physical 
            and mental happiness (4 kinds).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">2. May all beings who have life and 
            breath, i.e. who breathe, be free from danger, from mental distress, 
            from bodily suffering, and be able to shoulder the burden of one's 
            own <i>khandha </i>or material body with both physical and mental 
            happiness (4 kinds of <i>metta).</i></font></p>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">After the recitation of the words, "May 
          be free from danger" in the course of developing <i>metta, </i>the 
          mind that concentrates and the voice of utterance immediately come to 
          cease. This cessation of mind and matter, <i>nama </i>and <i>rupa, </i>must 
          also be contemplated. If contemplation is made as such, <i>metta samatha 
          </i>together with vipassana become developed in pairs. The continuous 
          contemplation of samatha and vipassana in pairs is called <i>yuganaddha 
          vipassana. </i>Let's recite and develop <i>metta </i>by applying this 
          method of <i>yuganaddha.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="3"><b>*</b></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">A 
          question may arise as to who are the ariyas, devas and humans in the 
          Nadir, and similarly, as to who are the people and <i>apaya</i> beings 
          in the Zenith. Such a question may be answered and elucidated as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If a person residing in the upper-storey 
          of a house or monastery, etc., while developing and radiating or sending 
          <i>metta, </i>there can be ariyas, devas and humans in the lower storeys 
          or in other similar places. While developing <i>metta </i>from the top 
          of a mountain, etc., there can be ariyas, devas and humans in places 
          at the foot of the mountain or low lying areas, such as valleys. If 
          the person who develops mindfulness of <i>metta </i>stays in the lowest 
          level or surface of the earth, there can be humans, devas and ariya-devas 
          living on the surface of the wide expanse of water in the ocean. In 
          the deep below the surface of water, there can be devas, and ariya-devas. 
          In this connection, recollection may be made of the belief entertained 
          by some people that Ashin Upagupta is residing in the sea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In much the same way, if <i>metta is </i>developed 
          while remaining on the surface of the earth, there can be human beings 
          on the higher level of the earth, on the elevated planes, on the hills 
          or mountains, or on the upper-storeys of the house or monastery. Moreover, 
          animals such as, insects, birds, etc., may be present in those places 
          higher up - or in the firmament. In the Chapter relating to the story 
          of Vinita of Fourth Parajika paragraph of the Rules of Discipline and 
          in the Nidana Vagga Lakkhana Sanyutta Pali, it has been stated that 
          there are petas in the sky or the firmament running about bitterly crying 
          in great pain. This bears testimony to the presence of apaya beings 
          in the higher region up in the sky. In regard to insects, flies, birds 
          and other animals with wings moving through or flying in the air up 
          in the sky or heaven, they can be clearly seen even with the naked eye.</font></p>
<hr size="1"/>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">What has been recited and developed is 
          a brief but comprehensive account of the 528 kinds of <i>metta. </i>This 
          is the manner in which persons who are accomplished with <i>metta jhana, 
          </i>have immersed themselves in a trance of <i>jhana. </i>In any case, 
          those who have not yet achieved the <i>jhana, </i>could also radiate 
          <i>metta bhavana </i>in the same manner as stated. Those who have special 
          perfection or <i>paramitas </i>may even attain <i>metta jhana while 
          </i>developing <i>metta. </i>Then, in the event of failing to achieve 
          <i>jhana, </i>beneficial results will be undoubtedly accrued as mentioned 
          below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Bhikkhave - 0, </i>Monks! <i>Bhikkhu 
          - </i>a monk, <i>Metta cittam </i>- by being able to entertain or dwell 
          upon the noble thoughts of loving-kindness for the sake of another's 
          happiness, even for a flick of a second <i>(Iccharayasanghatamattampi) 
          - </i>(Reference<i> </i>Anguttara Ekakanipata 53 Sutta), and if such 
          thought were borne in his mind with attentive concentration (Ref.: 54 
          &amp; 55 of that Sutta), the monk who has so developed his mind in imparting 
          <i>metta </i>to others, is deemed to be a person not devoid or divested 
          of <i>jhana, </i>or<i> </i>a person who strictly conforms to the practice 
          as instructed and admonished by the Blessed One. Furthermore, he is 
          also a person truly deserving of accepting without vanity the gift of 
          meals offered by the people of the country or citizens. Hence, how it 
          could be said that those monks who have frequently practised and developed 
          the feeling of lovingkindness, would have been deprived of <i>jhana? 
          </i>This is the preaching of the Buddha, and as such, there is hardly 
          any doubt that developing <i>metta is </i>highly advantageous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">According to this <i>desana, </i>even 
          if the feeling of <i>metta, </i>loving-kindness, is fostered for a very 
          brief duration of a split-second, he who exercises this goodwill or 
          benevolent feeling towards others may be said to be a person who is 
          not devoid of <i>jhana</i>-contemplation. He shall be deemed a person 
          who has truly practised in compliance with the due admonition of the 
          Blessed One. If he were a monk, he is deservedly worthy of enjoying 
          the meals offered by his benefactors. He may be regarded as having enjoyed 
          the meals or food so offered there by making the donor gain merits or 
          benefits. It is because if the meals are taken by the monks without 
          self-examination or contemplation, i.e., <i>paccavekkhanam, </i>it would 
          amount to accepting and taking meals on deferred payment of loans. The 
          reason being that if a monk not being accomplished with <i>sila</i>, 
          eat the meals which should be taken or consumed by a monk fully accomplished 
          with all four moral precepts, it is similar to taking the meals on credit 
          system, saying that he would only later repay it by fulfilling the required 
          <i>sila, </i>morality or precepts. Also, full benefits will only be 
          derived by the alms-giver if he offers anything in charity to a monk 
          who is fully accomplished with the four <i>silas. </i>Therefore, the 
          Commentaries have said that the enjoyment or partaking of the four kinds 
          of property, such as meals, etc., without reflecting with his intelligence 
          and without consideration, will amount to taking things on loan for 
          which he will have to account for.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A monk who is developing <i>metta </i>towards 
          others even for a moment, shall be deemed to have accepted the gifts 
          in the role of a real owner. He is like one who inherits the properties. 
          That is the reason why it may be construed as consuming or partaking 
          of things or food offered, without vanity or futility. Atthakatha goes 
          to say that <i>"(sanghe) dinna danam" - </i>the<i> </i>gift 
          that is given, or rather, offerings bestowed on the Order of monks <i>"mahathiyam 
          hoti mahapphalam" </i>- have great reward. For being beneficial 
          as such, it may be said to be consumed without futility.</font></p>

          of Developing Metta</font></b><font size="3"><i> </i><b>by Ashin Subuti</b></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The exercise of mindfulness on <i>metta 
          </i>can bring about much benefit particularly in the interest of the 
          donors. Such being the case, Ashin Subuti Thera, an arahat, used to 
          enter into a trance of <i>jhana metta </i>while stopping a while in 
          front of every house when going round for alms. Only after arising from 
          this <i>metta jhana</i>, he accepted the offering of food. This is done 
          so with a view to bestowing beneficial results on the male and female 
          benefactors. The said Ashin Subuti later received the highest approbation 
          from the Buddha and was conferred upon with the pre-eminent title of 
          <i>etadagga </i>(foremost) of all the noble disciple-donees - recipients 
          of alms. Nowadays, on the occasion of religious functions held in connection 
          with the offerings of gifts in charity, the Metta Sutta Paritta is recited 
          by monks for the benefit of the donors. Hence, where chanting <i>metta 
          paritta </i>as a blessing on any such occasion, it should also be properly 
          and seriously recited by developing <i>metta.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It is important to note that developing 
          <i>metta </i>while listening to the sermon is really advantageous. <i>Metta 
          bhavana </i>needs to be developed as and when opportunity affords, and 
          at any place wherever you may be. In the least, it should be developed 
          immediately after worshipping the Buddha as much as time permits. If 
          circumstances are favourable, <i>metta jhana </i>can be achieved soon 
          even while <i>metta is </i>being developed through meditation. It is 
          similar to the case of Dhananjhani, a Brahmin, as narrated below.</font></p>

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Dhananjhani 
          and Metta-jhana</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When Dhananjhani, the Brahmin, was on 
          the threshold of death in his sick-bed, a request was made at this instance 
          to invite Ashin Sariputta. Ashin Sariputta responded to the invitation 
          and came over to see Dhananjhani. Ashin Sariputta asked him how he was 
          getting on, or to put it in another way, whether he was feeling better 
          or not, and then, preached as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">To a question that was first put as: "Which 
          of the two, viz: Hell or animal realm is better than the other, etc.? 
          Dhananjhani answered, <i>tiracchana </i>i.e., animal is better than 
          hell, etc. Questions and answers which followed thereafter, related 
          to the comparisons made between animal and peta, peta and uuman. Human 
          beings and <i>catummaharajika, </i>etc., and then the conversation went 
          on extending up to the <i>paranimmitavasavatti, </i>the highest of devalokas. 
          Later, a question was put as to whether the life of devas in the Abode 
          of <i>paranimmitavasavatti </i>was better than Brahmaloka or not. On 
          hearing the name of 'Brahmaloka', Dhananjhani became encouraged and 
          asked with an exultant feeling, "Do you, my Reverend Ashin Sariputta, 
          really mean to say 'Brahmaloka'?". This question made Ashin Sariputta 
          realise that Dhananjhani was mentally inclined towards Brahmaloka, and 
          therefore, he stated that he would explain the practice of the path 
          leading to Brahmaloka, and then started preaching as follows:</font></p>

          all beings living in one region or place, <i>pharitva viharati - </i>remains 
          shedding his loving-kindness. <i>Tattha dutiyam - </i>likewise remains 
          spreading his feeling of <i>metta </i>to the second region. <i>Tattha

          happiness to others, <i>vipulena - </i>and<i> </i>spread the mind covering 
          all areas extensively; <i>mahaggatena - </i>with<i> </i>the lofty mind 
          of <i>mahaggatta jhana, appamaneyna - </i>which<i> </i>is boundless 
          or unlimited, <i>averena - </i>and<i> </i>with the mind free from hatred, 
          <i>avyapajchena - </i>along with the mind free from unpleasantness, 
          <i>pharitva viharati - </i>radiates loving-kindness. <i>Dhananjhani 
          - </i>Dhananjhani Brahmin, <i>ayam - </i>the<i> </i>practice of diffusing 
          or radiating <i>metta, </i>loving-kindness, <i>brahmanam sahavyataya 
          </i>- is for the purpose of staying in the company of Brahmas as a companion, 
          nay, it is a path - <i>maggo -</i> leading one to become a Brahma.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The gist of it is that radiating the feeling 
          of <i>metta, </i>loving-kindness, to all beings in the <i>ten </i>regions 
          is the way or the path of practice to ascend to the Brahma World. The 
          manner of shedding the light of compassion - <i>karuna</i>, rejoicing 
          with others happiness - <i>mudita</i>, and illumination of the feeling 
          of indifference - <i>upekkha, </i>has been preached in the same manner. 
          After benevolently preaching the said Dhamma, Ashin Sariputta returned 
          to the monastery. Later, he respectfully informed the Lord Buddha of 
          the speech and preaching delivered by him to Dhananjhani. Thereupon, 
          the Exalted One reprimanded Ashin Sariputta as: "Is this the way 
          you have instructed Dhananjhani so as to enable him to ascend to Brahmaloka 
          which is obviously inferior as compared to Nibbana, and then, made your 
          way back here despite the fact that there is a better method of practice 
          to be exercised to achieve <i>ariya-magga-phala </i>which is much nobler 
          than the <i>brahma-vihara-jhana?" </i>Buddha then went on to say 
          that Dhananjhani was now dead and gone and had already reached the Brahmaloka 
          after his demise. Having received this admonition from the Buddha, Ashin 
          Sariputta was said to have visited the Abode of Brahmas and delivered 
          his sermon to Dhananjhani Brahma. From </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">that 
          time onwards, when preaching was made relating to a <i>gatha </i>or 
          verse, consisting of four stanzas, it has been stated in the commentary 
          that it was always done without departure from, or rather, without omitting 
          the Four Noble Truths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In this connection what is really intended 
          to be known is that Dhananjhani, the Brahmin, had been asked to develop 
          <i>metta, </i>etc., and had thereby attained <i>jhana </i>within a short 
          time of about half-an-hour before his death. By virtue of this <i>jhana, 
          </i>he had reached the World of Brahmas. It should therefore be remembered 
          that in the absence of any other special <i>kusala; </i>merits, on which 
          one can make reliance on the verge of death, the development of <i>metta 
          </i>will prove to be an asset or a virtue on which reliance can be made. 
          The best is, of course, to contemplate and note, and become aware of 
          all obvious phenomenal occurrences as in case of those who are benefited 
          by the Vipassana method of contemplating on mindfulness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Furthermore, the highly beneficial effect 
          of <i>metta bhavana </i>- developing <i>metta </i>through meditation 
          - had been explained by the Buddha in the Nidana Sanyutta Okkha Sutta 
          (455) in the manner described below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Developing your mind with <i>metta </i>for 
          a brief period of time involved in milking a cow once in the morning, 
          once in daytime and once at night time, or smelling a fragrance for 
          once only, is far more advantageous than the offering of meals by cooking 
          a hundred big pots of rice, once in the morning, once in the daytime 
          and once at night time, which would, of course, tantamount to feeding 
          about 3000 people in all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It is therefore quite evident that developing 
          <i>metta </i>only for a moment and deriving much benefit thereof, is 
          really precious and invaluable without incurring expense and without 
          involving time and labour.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Moreover, the advantages of <i>metta bhavana 
          </i>have been taught in the Anguttara Pali Ekadasanipata Metta Sutta 
          (542) as herein after mentioned.</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Mettaya bhikkhave cetovimuttiya

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="1"> <font size="3">(13) </font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">The 
          Eleven Advantages of Metta</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Briefly stated, the eleven advantages 
          of <i>metta </i>that are worthy of note and remembrance are the states 
          of mind which have been developed, observed and depended upon several 
          times, similar to the vehicles or carriages that have been maintained 
          properly and kept in readiness for use. They are those which have been 
          properly practised and firmly established. The feeling of <i>metta </i>should 
          be free from <i>nivaranas, </i>obstacles, such as ill-will etc. Ordinarily, 
          <i>metta </i>is to be regarded as mere loving-kindness. However, from 
          the point of view of <i>cetovimutti, </i>i.e. the serenity of mind emancipated 
          from human passions, it should be taken as the<i> jhanic</i> mind. It 
          has been explained as such in the commentary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The eleven advantages, if enumerated, 
          may be stated as (1) It gives a sound sleep or rather, an uninterrupted 
          slumber. Those who are lacking in the practice of meditation are restless 
          before falling asleep in their sleeping-couch or bed. They may perhaps 
          be snoring. On the other hand, a person equipped with <i>metta</i> <i>bhavana</i> 
          has a peaceful sleep with an undisturbed mind. When fallen asleep, he 
          sleeps at peace and happily just like a person who has immersed himself 
          in a trance of samapatti. This is the first advantage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">And next (2) <i>Sukham</i> <i>patibhujjhati</i> 
          - happily rouses from sleep. When waking up from sleep some have stirred 
          up with a grumble. Some may have to swing and stretch their arms and 
          legs, or may have to make other bodily movements or roll on before getting 
          up from bed. Those who go to sleep after developing <i>metta</i> will 
          not suffer such miserable conditions, and they rouse from sleep happily 
          and as fresh as the blooming lotus flowers. According to Dhammapada 
          verses: <i>Suppabuddham pabdujjhanti</i> <i>sada</i> <i>Gotama savaka, 
          yesam diva ca ratto ca, niccam buddhagata soti,</i> etc., i.e., those 
          who are practising meditation, such as, developing contemplation of 
          <i>Buddhanussati</i> - Mindfulness on the Noble Attributes of the Buddha, 
          have the advantages of sound sleep and joy or happiness when waking 
          up from sleep. It should be noted that special emphasis has purposely 
          been made on the peculiar characteristics of <i>metta</i> <i>bhavana</i> 
          because of its qualities in deriving such benefits.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(3) <i>Papakam supinam</i> - evil or bad 
          dreams will not present themselves in sleep. There are instances where 
          a vision may appear in one's sleep as if he has fallen down from a very 
          high altitude, or has been ill-treated by others, or has suffered from 
          snake-bite, etc. A person developing <i>metta </i>will<i> </i>not have 
          such weird or frightful dreams, but will have pleasant and sweet dreams, 
          as if he is worshipping the Buddha, or is flying through the air with 
          <i>jhana, </i>or listening to the sermon and the like which give him 
          delight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>(4) Manussanam piyo hoti</i> - Others 
          will adore him or have affection for him because of his accomplishment 
          of the noble attributes. He will be spreading his loving-kindness to 
          others and will never cause harm to others. Those who are near and dear 
          to him will not find fault with him. He is tolerant too, and having 
          the serenity of mind with compassion for others, he is loved and respected 
          by all who come into contact with him. Developing metta from the bottom 
          of his heart is the best attribute which invokes or causes to invite 
          affection and respect from others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>(5) Amanussanam piyo hoti - </i>He 
          is also loved by devas. The fourth and the fifth advantages indicate 
          that he is loved, by all human beings and devas. An instance has been 
          shown in the Visuddhimagga as to how love and respect have been bestowed 
          upon by devas.</font></p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="3">The Story of Visakha Theri</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At one time, there lived a rich man by 
          the name of Visikha in the city of Pataliputta. While residing in Pataliputta, 
          he had heard of the news of the existence of many Buddhist shrines and 
          pagodas in the island of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), so numerous that they 
          resembled a necklace of flowers. The entire place was said to be glowing 
          with the bright colour of the yellow robes donned by monks. Every place 
          was safe and secure and one could peacefully reside and spend the night 
          anywhere without menace. Weather was favourable and conducive to good 
          health. Pleasant were the monasteries which went in harmony with the 
          fine and gentle behaviour of the people, both physical and mental, which 
          thereby created a congenial atmosphere for listening to the sermons 
          with peace of mind and devotion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">These favourable circumstances had caused 
          him to reflect that it would be feasible for him to proceed to Ceylon 
          and enter into the monkhood. With this bent of mind, he transferred 
          all his business enterprise and properties to his wife and children. 
          After having done so, he left his home with only one (rupee) kyat in 
          his pocket. At a seaport town, he had to wait for a month to set off 
          on his journey by a sea-going vessel. In those old days, sea-going vessels 
          were not the present type of steam-ships but big boats with sails (sailing 
          boats). Being endowed with the gift of business acumen, he started indulging 
          in trading, buying and selling goods by moving about from one place 
          to another while waiting for the boat to arrive. He earned a thousand 
          rupees by legally buying and selling goods inside a month. Trading in 
          a legal way means buying articles or commodities, paying what is really 
          worth, and selling them at a correct price. In ancient times, a margin 
          of profit of only two picepyas was usually taken on a capital outlay 
          of one rupee. Buying and selling goods by fair means with correct price 
          is called <i>vammika vanijia </i>which means trading according to law 
          honestly. Carrying on trade in a legitimate way for one's livelihood 
          as mentioned, is <i>samma ajiva, </i>right livelihood. However, it appears 
          that it was not the intention of Visakha, the rich, to deal in such 
          business transaction for his subsistence. It seems his natural inclination 
          that had actually spurred him to deal in trading business. This is evident 
          from the fact that he had later discarded all his money derived from 
          the said business venture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Thereafter, this rich man Visakha left 
          the port and reached Ceylon where at Mahavihara monastery, he made a 
          request to be ordained a monk. On his way to the Sima, one thousand 
          rupees (kyats) in cash which he carried in his `pouch tucked up at his 
          waist, slipped out accidentally. When the senior priest who had escorted 
          him to the <i>Sima </i>inquired of him as to what were these meant for, 
          he replied, "Your Reverend, this is my own money worth one thousand 
          rupees." On being instructed by the Mahatheras as: "O, Upasaka 
          (devout layman). Under the Rules of Discipline, from the time of your 
          becoming an ordained monk, you cannot possibly handle and manage the 
          cash, and as such, you may make your own arrangements to dispense with 
          this money right now." Visakha responded, 'I do; not wish to see 
          all those who would favour me with their presence at my Ordination, 
          return home empty-handed." So saying, he threw away all one thousand 
          rupees to let them fall scattering among the crowd of devotees outside 
          the precincts of the Sima <i>(Thein). </i>Only after having done so, 
          he received ordination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">This rich man was named Ashin Visakha 
          in the role of a priest. For five years, he strove to study and took 
          his training in the field of Vinaya Rules and Precepts called Dvematika. 
          After completion of five <i>Vassa, </i>he took up Kammatthana meditation 
          practice for four months each at four different monasteries. While practising 
          as such, he once made his way to a forest, remained in one solitary 
          place, and then made a joyous utterance of hymn reflecting upon his 
          noble attributes, as follows:</font></p>
<ul>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Yavata upasampanno, yavata 
            idha agato.<br/>
</font></i><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">Etthantare khalitam natthi, 
            aho labha te marisa."</font></i></p>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Yavata upasampanno - </i>from<i> </i>the 
          time of my first entering into priesthood, <i>Yavata upasampanno - </i>until<i>
</i>I arrived at this forested area, <i>etthantare </i>- during this 
          period of interval, <i>khalitam - </i>failure<i> </i>in the observance 
          of moral precepts concerning the priests, <i>natthi </i>- had never 
          happened or taken place. Marisa - 0, Venerable Visakha, <i>te - </i>your<i>, 
          labha - </i>gains<i> </i>and advantages relating to the morality of 
          priests, <i>aho - </i>were<i> </i>indeed wonderful!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Later, Ashin Visakha proceeded to one 
          monastery on Cittala mountain situated at the extreme end of the southern 
          range. On his way, he reached a junction of the road where he stopped 
          for a while, his mind wavering as to which route he should resume his 
          journey. At this juncture, a guardian angel of the mountain appeared 
          and directed him pointing the hand towards the path saying, "This 
          is the route you should take." After four months had elapsed since 
          his arrival at Cittala monastery, one day at dawn he was lying down 
          planning to leave the monastery for another place. While he was thus 
          reflecting, a <i>rukkha-devata, </i>guardian angel of a tree, called 
          Manila, which stood at the head of the terrace, was said to have been 
          found sitting on a step of the stairs, and crying.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Visakha Thera then asked, "Who are 
          you and why are you weeping?' The guardian angel replied, "I'm 
          the guardian spirit of that <i>'Thabye' </i>tree." To the query 
          as to why he was weeping, the reply given was that he was crying feeling 
          sorry and dejected for the imminent departure of Visakha Thera from 
          this place. Visakha then questioned him, "What noble advantages 
          you all have derived by my sojourn here?" The guardian spirit said 
          in reply, "Sir, your presence here has brought about a feeling 
          of loving-kindness among us - the Devas; and if you are going to leave. 
          this place, quarrel will break out among the Devas who will also utter 
          harsh words hurting one another's feelings." Visakha then said, 
          "If my stay here will bring happiness to you all, I will have to 
          stay on." He continued to reside at the monastery for another four 
          months. Similar incidents happened again and again at the end of every 
          four months, and Visakha was forced to stay on and on at this Cittala 
          monastery until the time of his death - <i>Parinibbana. </i>This piece 
          of anecdote is a clear and salient example illustrated in the Visuddhimagga 
          showing how a person who is developing <i>metta is </i>loved and respected 
          by the Devas.</font></p>

          giving protection or guard is stated to be similar to the kind of protection 
          given by the parents to their only son through love. If the nats are 
          going to render help and protection, one will definitely be free from 
          dangers and will also gain happiness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(7)<i> Assa - </i>In<i> </i>regard to 
          a person who is developing <i>metta, aggi va visam va satham va </i>- 
          either fire, or poison, or 'dah' (a kind of sword with one-edged blade), 
          or any other dangerous weapon that can cause physical harm, <i>kamati 
          - </i>will<i> </i>not befall him. In other words, no danger, such as, 
          fire, poison, and lethal weapons like dahs, spears, arrows, etc., can 
          cause bodily injury to an individual who is developing loving-kindness. 
          Firearms, bombs, missiles and such other modern weaponry which can inflict 
          bodily harm to a person may be regarded as being included in the list 
          of lethal weapons. Therefore, when any kind of danger becomes imminent, 
          it would be advisable to seriously develop mindfulness on <i>metta. 
          </i>In this connection, Visuddhimagga has cited a number of instances, 
          such as, the case of a female devotee by the name of Uttara who had 
          escaped scalds from the burning oil, or the case of Culasiva Thera, 
          a famous scholar of Samyutta Nikaya who was immune from poison, or the 
          case of Samkicca, Samanera who had escaped from the deadly effects of 
          sharp weapons. Besides, a story of a cow which had become invulnerable 
          against the piercing blows of a spear was cited as an illustration. 
          At one time, a cow was feeding an infant calf. A hunter tried to hit 
          this cow several times with his spear. However, every time the sharp-pointed 
          spear-head struck the body of the cow when plunged, the pointed edge 
          of the spear twisted or coiled up like a palm leaf instead of penetrating 
          through the skin. This had so happened not because of <i>upaca appana 
          jhana </i>but because of her pure and intense love for her young son 
          the calf. The influence of metta is indeed powerful even to that extent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Among these stories, the one relating 
          to Uttara is quite outstanding as it is contained in the Dhammapada. 
          A brief account of it will be quoted as an excerpt.</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="3"> (15) </font><font face="Arial" size="3">The 
          Story of Uttara</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Maung Ponna was the name of Uttara's father. 
          He was at first a poor man in the employ of one Sumana, a millionaire 
          from the city of Rajagaha. One day, he donated a piece of thin stick 
          of a plant, a kind of tooth-brush used by monks for cleaning the teeth 
          (called <i>dampu</i>) and clean water for washing the face to Ashin 
          Sariputta Thera who had just arisen from <i>Samapatti. </i>His<i> </i>wife 
          also on the same day, on her way to the place where he was ploughing 
          the field bringing a packet of rice meal for him too came across Ashin 
          Sariputta. With an overwhelming generosity at the sight of the Venerable 
          Ashin Sariputta, she offered the packet of rice-meal to the Arahat and 
          shared her merits with her husband. By virtue of these meritorious deeds, 
          it is said that the entire plot of land ploughed by Maung Ponna had 
          suddenly transformed into a field of pure gold. At the present day, 
          this kind of incident may be considered ludicrous - as a sort of "Believe 
          it or not" story. However, in those ancient times, special and 
          peculiar advantages had been derived depending upon the moral qualities 
          of certain outstanding persons or donees, who possessed, special noble 
          attributes. There is reason to believe so, judging the nature of queer 
          inventions of wonderful electronic mechanical devices such as computers, 
          missiles and satellites which would ordinarily be considered unbelievable. 
          Peculiar and astonishing happenings might have therefore occurred in 
          those old days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Since his plot of cultivable land had 
          turned into pure solid gold, the poor Maung Ponna became fabulously 
          rich. At some future date, the wealthy Sumana solicited U Ponna to give 
          his daughter Uttara in marriage to his son. U Ponna, his wife and their 
          daughter Uttara had already become <i>Sotapannas </i>after listening 
          to the sermon delivered by the Buddha since the time of the opening 
          ceremony of their new residence, held immediately after Maung Ponna 
          had acquired his immense wealth and fortune. On the other hand, the 
          whole family of Sumana, the rich man, was of different religion and 
          none of the members of their household was a Buddhist. For this particular 
          reason, the proposal made by Sumana was not accepted by Ponna, the millionaire. 
          He was quite outspoken in telling Sumana that Sumana's son had his faith 
          in heretical doctrine whereas, his daughter, being a devout Buddhist 
          could not help taking her refuge in the Triple Gem and that the proposed 
          marriage would therefore be incompatible. For this simple reason he 
          was unable to give his consent to the proposal made by Sumana. However, 
          on being advised by many of his friends with a request not to get estranged 
          in his relationship with Sumana, he finally acquiesced, and then Uttara 
          was eventually given in marriage to Sumana's son.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">On the Full Moon day of Waso, Uttara had 
          to accompany her husband to the home of Sumana's family. Since the day 
          of her arrival at her husband's house, she had had no opportunity to 
          seek her refuge in, and pay homage to Sanghas and Bhikkhunis. Neither 
          had she obtained any chance to do any act of charity or <i>dana, </i>and 
          to listen to the noble Dhamma. This state of affairs having lasted for 
          two and a half months, Uttara was compelled to send information to her 
          father about her plight. What she had conveyed in her message was: "Why 
          should I be locked up and kept under detention? It would perhaps be 
          better to declare me outright that I am their mean slave. It appears 
          unjustifiable to let me be tied down and married to a heretic, nay, 
          a man holding a heretical view. Since my arrival here up till now, I 
          have been deprived of the opportunity to see or pay my respects and 
          homage to sanghas and monks and perform any kind of meritorious acts."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Having heard this news, her father felt 
          very much depressed, and lamented, "What a pity! My daughter is 
          undoubtedly suffering misery." He therefore sent a sum of fifteen 
          thousand rupees (kyats) to his daughter Uttara. At that time, there 
          lived a woman of some renown by the, name of Thirima in the city of 
          Rajagaha. She earned her living by prostitution, taking a fee of one 
          thousand rupees for every night spent by her with a man. This girl Thirima 
          was hired for a sum of fifteen thousand rupees to look after and make 
          Uttara's husband happy for a period of 15 days. The money sent to Uttara 
          by her father was to enable her to do merits - <i>kusala</i> - freely 
          within a space of 15 days. She then summoned Thirima who, after consultation, 
          agreed to be hired to Uttara's husband. With the express consent of 
          Thirima, she was taken to Uttara's husband from whom permission was 
          sought by Uttara that for a period of 15 days she would like to freely 
          devote herself to performance of merits and that this Thirima would 
          in the meantime look after him properly. Her husband being delightfully 
          impressed with Thirima's beauty and charm readily agreed to abide by 
          the terms presented by Uttara.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Commencing from that<b> </b>day, Uttara 
          daily accorded her invitation to the sanghas headed by the Buddha and 
          offered meals in alms at her residence. She also listened to the sermons 
          and then personally managed in preparing meals, etc., for the sanghas. 
          On the 14th, Waxing day of Thadingyut, her husband when looking at the 
          kitchen down below through the window of his residential building, saw 
          his wife Uttara personally managing and supervising the work of cooking 
          food and preparing meals for the sanghas. She was perspiring and looking 
          dirty with soot on her face. Finding her in such a predicament, he bemused, 
          "0, what a foolish creature! She cannot find enjoyment in the luxury 
          and comforts of this substantial and well furnished building. How surprising 
          is it that she could only find her satisfaction and pleasure in doing 
          service to these bald-headed monks! </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">He 
          then retreated his steps from the window smiling.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When Thirima found him wearing a smile 
          on his face, curiosity had aroused in her wanting to know the reason 
          for his demeanour. She therefore went towards the window and on observation 
          being made, saw Uttara in the kitchen. A feeling of jealousy then crept 
          up in her and she thought to herself as: '0, this son of a millionaire 
          still seems to have his close connection with this blooming base female 
          creature." Marvellous indeed! She considered herself as the real 
          landlady and owner of the big mansion after her sojourn for only 15 
          days. In fact, she had entirely forgotten that she was living in that 
          place on hire. Nevertheless, she became envious and resentful against 
          Uttara. Apart from that, she bore grudge against Uttara. Hence, with 
          her ill will to make Uttara miserable, she came down the stairs. Then 
          making her way to the kitchen, she took a cup of boiling butter and 
          went close to Uttara to do mischief. Seeing Thirima, Uttara immediately 
          reflected and began developing a feeling of loving-kindness and said 
          to herself in soliloquy: "My friend </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">Thirima 
          has done a lot of benefits to me. The Universe is comparatively narrow 
          as compared to the world of advantages bestowed upon me by Thirima. 
          The advantages are immense, and it is because of her care and attention 
          given to my husband that I have been able to perform the charitable 
          deeds and listen to the Dhamma. If I have harboured any feeling of resentment 
          or anger, may this scorchingly hot butter-oil which Thirima is carrying 
          with her cause me harm by scalding. If, on the contrary, I have no feeling 
          of animosity or anger against her, no harm or injury may befall me." 
          She solemnly took oath of the truth of her noble-mindedness in the manner 
          stated, and radiated her loving-kindness, metta, to Thirima. The burning 
          hot liquid of butter which Thirima cruelly poured upon her had the reverse 
          effect of coolness of fresh water.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Thirima then reflected, "This cream 
          of butter which has melted appears getting cold." She therefore 
          again went off and fetched another cupful of boiled hot butter from 
          the frying pan. Finding her doing what was considered horrible, the 
          maids attending on Uttara nearby became indignant and uttered, "Go 
          away . . . you foolish bitch. Don't pour this burning oil on our Mistress." 
          They simultaneously threatened her, gave her a good beating and kicked 
          her about. This made Thirima fall flat on the ground. Uttara </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">intervened 
          to deter her maids from causing bodily harm to Thirima but to no avail. 
          At this juncture, Uttara asked Thirima with a feeling of reprobation, 
          "0, Thirima, what has made you commit such an awful and serious 
          crime, etc." So saying, she immediately caused her to be given 
          a warm bath and anointed - with an extremely soft grease or jelly (lubricant) 
          to relieve her pain and suffering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Only then, realisation came to Thirima 
          that she was rendering her service on hire and tendered her apology, 
          begging Uttara to forgive her. Uttara then instructed Thirima to make 
          an apology to and beg for pardon from her "father", the Lord 
          Buddha. Briefly stated, as arranged by Uttara, Thirima proceeded to 
          the Buddha and His disciple - Sanghas, paid her obeisance, offered meals 
          in donation, and tendered her apology. Buddha then gave an exhortation, 
          preaching the Dhamma in the form of a verse which, in essence, conveys 
          the meaning - "Make a conquest of an angry man by 'patience' without 
          spite and getting angry." After having heard this sermon, Thirima 
          together with other five hundred females attained <i>Sotapanna. </i>The 
          significant point intended to be stressed in the story now cited is 
          that Uttara, the female devotee, had escaped from the burning heat of 
          the boiling butter-oil poured upon her by virtue of contemplating and 
          developing loving-kindness <i>(metta bhavana).</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Relating to the story of Culasiva Thera 
          who became invulnerable from poison, no elaborated account was found 
          in the present Atthakatha and Tikas. In regard to the events concerning 
          Samkicca <i>Samanera, </i>it<i> </i>has already-been mentioned in the 
          Tuvataka Sutta (Burmese version) at page 90 wherein reference is only 
          made to the fact that he had plunged himself in <i>jhana. </i>It was 
          not obvious as to what kind of <i>jhana </i>he had developed. In the 
          present instance, however, according to what has been stated in the 
          Visuddhimagga, it is to be regarded as developing <i>metta jhana. </i>This 
          would mean that immunity was gained from the dangers of fire, poison 
          and other lethal weapons, such as a sword or a <i>dah.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(8) <i>"'Tuvatam samadhiyati", 
          </i>which means that the mind also quickly becomes stabilised and calm. 
          To develop mindfulness wishing others happy is appropriate and easy 
          inasmuch as everybody is willing to gain happiness. Hence, the mind 
          is very likely to become tranquil within a short time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(9) The next advantage is <i>'Mukhavanno 
          vippasidati", </i></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">i.e. the 
          complexion of the face can become clear. As stated earlier, it should 
          be developed as may be considered appropriate. It is easier, of course. 
          This will undoubtedly bring clear complexion of the face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(10) The next is: <i>""Asammuhlo 
          kalam karoti"'. </i>That is to say "Death takes place without 
          bewilderment or perplexity." This is really important. When one 
          is approaching death, he is likely to die without being able to gain 
          proper concentration and mindfulness because of very severe pain, ache 
          or tiredness which he has to suffer, or is likely to pass away with 
          a feeling of greed or anger, or under delusion with a mistaken view 
          imagining all sorts of erroneous thoughts. This is how death usually 
          comes upon a person with the mind perplexed ridden by all kinds of entanglements. 
          When death occurs to one in the manner as stated, it is almost certain 
          that he is destined for the four <i>Apayas </i>or Nether World. However, 
          in some cases where one is in a state of coma or semi-consciousness, 
          the mind may impinge on or stick to sensations relating to merits, or 
          on <i>nimittas </i>(omens) concerning <i>Sugati, </i>i.e. the abode 
          of Devas and the human world, fairly at ease. In that case, a person 
          can hope to reach <i>Sugati, </i>an existence where happy conditions 
          prevail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(11) This is the last kind of advantage 
          expressed in Pali as: <i>"Uttari appati vijjhanto," It </i>goes 
          to say that if <i>arahatta phala, </i>the Fruition of Arahatship, is 
          not realised or attained beyond, or rather, outside the range of <i>metta 
          jhana, </i>or in other words, if <i>arahatta phala </i>which is superior 
          to <i>metta jhana </i>cannot be achieved, <i>brahmalokuipago - </i>Brahma 
          World will be reached. An ordinary worldling can reach the Abode of 
          Brahmas if he has achieved <i>metta jhana, </i>Sotapannas and Sakadagamis 
          may be reborn in the Brahma World. Of course, an Anagami is likely to 
          be reborn in the abode of Suddhavasa in the World of Brahmas. If <i>jhana 
          is </i></font><font face="Arial" size="-1">not attained and if only 
          ecstatic concentration approaching the attainment of <i>jhana (upacara 
          samadhi) is </i>achieved, he can reach the world of human beings, and 
          Devaloka which are existences known as <i>Sugati. </i>Dhananjhani, the 
          Brahmin, whose case had been earlier mentioned, had reached the Brahma 
          World for having acquired virtue by developing <i>metta, </i>etc., within 
          about half an hour before his death. This is particularly worthy of 
          note. It also deserves emulation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Having given teachings on the Brahmavihara 
          Dhamma in a fairly comprehensive way, I shall now continue to talk something 
          about Vipassana.</font></p>

          (16) </font><font face="Arial" size="3">Developing Metta and Vipassana<i>
</i>Meditation in combination</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">A person after achieving <i>jhana </i>by 
          developing <i>metta bhavana </i>can reach the stage of <i>arahatta phala 
          </i>if he continues to contemplate Vipassana depending on that <i>metta 
          jhana </i>as a basis. Even if falling short of <i>arahatta phala, </i>he 
          can reach <i>anagami-magga-phala </i>and become an Anagami. The way 
          to contemplate is to first enter into <i>metta jhana, </i>and when this 
          jhanic mind ceases, it is to contemplate on that <i>jhana. </i>This 
          method of plunging in <i>jhana </i>and then contemplating <i>jhana </i>in 
          turn by developing and contemplating Samatha and Vipassana in pairs, 
          is called <i>"yuganaddha", </i>i.e., equipping oneself with 
          meditation in pairs. The method of meditating Vipassana is the same 
          as the method of contemplating and noting by the present Yogis. It is 
          to contemplate and note what has been seen, or heard, or contacted, 
          or imagined as "seeing", "hearing", "contacting", 
          or "imagining", as the case may be. In the same way, after 
          the occurrence of the jhanic-mind, this jhanic-mind will have to be 
          contemplated and noted. The only difference is that a person who has 
          attained <i>jhana, </i>contemplates the jhanic-mind, whereas the present 
          Yogis, not being endowed with the jhanic-mind, should contemplate and 
          note the mind or consciousness that is aware of what has been seen, 
          etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">What shall be done now according to the 
          method of <i>yuganaddha </i>contemplation, is to develop <i>metta </i>reciting 
          as: "May all be happy". Then, contemplate with mindfulness 
          on loving-kindness in turn. Developing <i>metta </i>along with the contemplation 
          of metta-mindfulness in pairs, is the method. If so contemplated, the 
          mind that is intended to radiate to a particular person while recitation 
          is made, <i>rupa </i>- the material element which utters, the sense-object 
          of voice which sounds, and the mind-consciousness which dwells in his 
          heart while reciting as: "May all be happy", will all be found 
          vanishing instantaneously and continually. Such realisation or awareness 
          is the genuine Vipassana insight knowledge which knows the characteristics 
          of impermanence. This is stated as, <i>"khayatthena aniccam</i>" 
          (having ceased or vanished in a moment, it is impermanent). Let us bear 
          it in mind and contemplate in the course of our recitation in the following 
          manner:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all those monks, individuals and 
            Yogis residing in this meditation centre be happy. (repeat)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all beings in this meditation centre 
            be happy. (repeat)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all monks and individuals within 
            this township be happy. (repeat)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all beings in this township be happy. 
            (repeat)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all people living in the Union of 
            Burma be happy. (repeat).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">May all beings be happy. (repeat)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Every time it is recited as: "May 
          all be happy" with consciousness, the mind that is put into this 
          consciousness, and the mind that intends to recite, the bodily behaviour, 
          and the sense object of the voice which utters, immediately vanish.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b><font size="3">On the 
          Full Moon day of Waso, I explained how to develop metta.<i> </i>Most 
          of the teachings I gave then, referred to the derivation of <i>paramita 
          </i>and <i>kusala </i>by way of developing metta.<i> </i>From the point 
          of view of the Visuddhimagga (The Path of Purification) we have so far 
          only covered the manner of reflecting on the faults of the "anger",<i>

</font><font face="Arial" size="3">Way of sitting comfortably</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">We may add a little more according to 
          the teachings of the Buddha relating to the manner of assuming a comfortable 
          sitting posture for meditation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The Enlightened One has directed, <i>"Arannagato 
          va" </i>either by going into or residing in a forest, or, <i>"rukkhamulagato 
          va" </i>- by approaching or occupying a position under the shade 
          of a tree or close to the trunk end of the body of a tree, or, <i>"sunnagaragato 
          va' - </i>by staying in a monastery, or a house, or a building where 
          there are no people, nay, which stands in a solitary place, <i>"nisidati" 
          - </i>should sit down or be seated. Obviously our Lord Buddha in His 
          instructions, has given priority to practising meditation exercise in 
          a forested area. Only when one is unable to proceed to a forest, he 
          is advised to take his seat and meditate at the foot of a tree in a 
          quiet place. Then again, if it is impossible to do so, to practise meditation 
          in a monastery, or a house, or a building uninhabited by people, it 
          would be the best to select a secluded place where there is peace and 
          tranquillity. If, however, there is any other person who is indulging 
          in meditation in the same area it would be better if that person is 
          of the same sex. In any case, the best would be a secluded spot in a 
          remote area where there is no other person except the meditator.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The manner of sitting posture to be adopted 
          is stated <i>as. "Pallankam abhujitva," </i>'i.e., to sit 
          cross-legged. I have already explained about it in full. Furthermore, 
          at the time of sitting, the instruction given is:<i>"'Ujjumkayam 
          penidha</i>ya" i.e., the upper portion of the body above the waist 
          should be kept erect, straight and perpendicularly. If one sits down 
          loosely bending his back or twisting his body, the strength of his exertion 
          or effort will be weakened. That is the reason why it is necessary to 
          sit erect keeping the body above the waist perfectly upright. After 
          taking a sitting posture as described, the instruction given to be followed 
          is<i>: "Parimukham satam upathepettva". - </i>which means 
          to fix one's thoughts 'only on the object of sensation (sense-object) 
          and to engage oneself in active meditation with fixed concentration 
          without letting the mind go astray. 'In the present case of practising 
          <i>metta-Kammatthana, </i>the mind should be directed towards people 
          for whom lovingkindness is intended to be developed. It is essential 
          to know and understand from the very beginning as to who are those in 
          whose favour <i>Metta </i>should not be radiated or developed first, 
          and who are those not worthy of receiving <i>Metta.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Metta </i>should not be developed at 
          the beginning of the exercise towards: (1) persons who are hostile and 
          unfriendly, or who deserves hatred <i>(appiya); </i>(2) persons who 
          are dearest to you or your beloved ones, that is, those who, have close 
          affinity with the meditator through deep love <i>(atippiya); </i>(3) 
          persons who deserve neither love nor hatred, i.e., neutral persons; 
          and (4) persons who are enemies. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Justification for not developing <i>metta 
          </i>at the beginning from such people is because it would be difficult 
          to permeate the feeling of loving-kindness, or rather, it would be incongruous 
          to send your <i>metta </i>to one whom you hate. It is also rather hard 
          or awkward to transmit your <i>metta </i>first to one's beloved ones 
          like - your children, brothers and sisters. for whom you have intense 
          love and attachment. Neither will it be easy to develop loving-kindness 
          for people, such as, your own pupils or disciples and other neutral 
          persons. It is because, if persons for whom you have deep love and affection 
          are found to have become a bit miserable or have suffered, trouble and 
          misery, you would probably become highly depressed or dejected. Next, 
          it would also be difficult to put a stranger or a neutral person, who 
          is unfamiliar with you, in the role of a beloved, person. Yes, indeed. 
          It is well-nigh impossible to constantly radiate loving-kindness to 
          a complete stranger. Leave aside emitting loving-kindness to an enemy. 
          As regards an enemy, the moment you remember him, feeling of anger will 
          arise recalling the past incidents or memories of his wrong doings or 
          faults. They are the four kinds of people in whose favour or for whom 
          one should not develop <i>metta - </i>at the initial stage of the practise 
          of loving-kindness meditation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(1) Persons not belonging to the same

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(2) Persons who are dead and gone - <i>metta 
          </i>should not be developed towards such persons.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The reason for this abstention is that 
          between the two persons who are not of the same sex, say, of the two 
          persons - a male and a female - if a male or a man is particularly developing 
          <i>metta </i>towards a female or a woman, or, vice versa, i.e., if a 
          female is especially developing <i>metta </i>towards a male, sensual 
          or human passionate desires <i>(raga) </i>is<i> </i>likely to occur. 
          In the long time past, a son of a government minister asked his Mahathera, 
          his spiritual teacher, "Your reverend Sir, on whom should I bestow 
          my loving-kindness by developing <i>metta"'. </i>The Mahathera 
          replied that he should develop his <i>metta </i>in respect of a person 
          whom he loved and adored. Thereupon, the minister's son, being very 
          fond of .his wife, after keeping observance 'of the noble eight-fold 
          <i>silas (atthanga-sila) </i>i.e., moral precepts, on one day, took 
          his seat on the sleeping couch in a closed bedroom at night time, and 
          developed <i>metta </i>radiating his spirit of loving-kindness to his 
          darling wife with concentrated contemplation. While thus performing, 
          he became infatuated with extravagant passion <i>(raga). </i>He therefore 
          made an attempt to go to his wife. Under the inspired influence of his 
          sensuous desires, he entirely forgot about the door and in moving about 
          wildly losing control of himself, hit the wall many a time. Becoming 
          so angry and blinded by his passion, he struck the wall repeatedly with 
          his hand and kicked it. It seems that this had happened not for a while 
          or a few minutes. It has been stated in the Visuddhimagga as: <i>"sabbarattam" 
          - </i>throughout the whole night, <i>"bhitthiyuddhamakasi" 
          </i>(he) was at war with the masonry wall and fought against it. The 
          Visuddhimagga has also mentioned the upsurge of <i>raga </i>as being 
          an intrusion made by ra<i>ga </i>itself enticing under the guise of 
          <i>metta. </i>As attachment of <i>raga </i>has a tendency to take place 
          with vigour, <i>metta </i>should not be developed in a manner distinct 
          from others towards a person of the opposite sex. However, transmission 
          of <i>metta </i>for the purpose of gaining <i>paramita </i>and <i>kusala 
          </i>for about four, five, or ten times appears not prohibitive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">It is stated that if <i>metta </i>is<i>
</i>developed towards a person who was dead, neither <i>appana-jhana-samadhi, 
          </i>i.e. boundless and perfect concentration, by contemplation, nor, 
          <i>upacara-samadhi, </i>i.e. inferior type of proximate concentration, 
          can be achieved. A long time ago, a young Bhikkhu was said to be developing 
          <i>metta </i>dwelling his mind on his spiritual teacher. He was, however, 
          unable to reach the stage of <i>jhana-samapatti </i>which he had once 
          successfully practised and attained by indulging in ecstatic meditation. 
          When he made enquiries about his failure to attain the said<i> jhana 
          </i>as advised by a Mahathera, he found out that his spiritual teacher 
          had already passed away. Thence, he developed his <i>metta </i>towards 
          another person with his usual concentration. Only then was he able to 
          attain <i>metta-jhana. </i>Therefore, <i>metta </i>should not be developed 
          in respect of or towards a person who had already passed away.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In developing <i>metta </i>towards others, 
          priority should be given to one's own self. It is stated that first 
          and foremost <i>metta </i>should be developed towards one's own self 
          giving voice to "May I be happy and free from misery." Or, 
          <i>"</i>May I be free from danger, mental distress, bodily suffering, 
          and be able to. shoulder the burden of one's own <i>khandha </i>(material 
          body) with happiness." In developing <i>metta </i>for one's own 
          well-being, the intention, of course, is not to acquire merits. Nor 
          is it developed to gain <i>samadhi </i>(concentration). It is meant 
          to serve as an example by comparison that others also wish to be happy 
          like he himself wishes to be. One may be developing <i>metta </i>as: 
          "May I be happy for years and years, nay, for a hundred or thousand 
          years, but there is no possibility of achieving <i>appana-samadhi.</i> 
          If one is developing <i>metta </i>for his own well-being expressing 
          his own sentiment, "May I be happy", it would serve as an 
          evidence, or rather, stand witness to the fact that others would also 
          wish to be happy, or, to live happily and be alive and also be free 
          from misery as he himself wishes to be so. That is the reason why instruction 
          has been given to develop <i>metta </i>towards one's own Self, or one's 
          own wellbeing initially when beginning with the exercise. The Visuddhimagga 
          has said so. The Enlightened One has made an exposition by preaching 
          a Verse as quoted below which indicates that a person loves his own 
          self the most.</font></p>

            him se paramattakamo.</font></i></p>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Sabba disa - </i>all<i> </i>ten regions 
          or places, <i>cetasa - </i>with<i> </i>imagination or thoughts, <i>anuparigamma 
          - </i>going<i> </i>round and round in search of, <i>attana piyataram 
          - a </i>person who deserves more love and affection than one's own Self, 
          <i>kvaci - </i>in<i> </i>any place or anywhere<i>, neva allhaga - </i>cannot<i>
</i>be found. <i>Evam, </i>Similarly, <i>pareysam - </i>other<i> </i>people 
          also, <i>puthu atta - </i>with<i> </i>reference to their own respective 
          Self, piyo - love (himself) the most. <i>Tasama - </i>Inasmuch<i> </i>as 
          every being loves his own Self the most, <i>attakamo - </i>one<i> </i>who 
          loves his own Self, nay, who cares most of his own welfare or for his 
          own good, <i>param</i> - will not cause another person, <i>na him se 
          - </i>suffer<i>, </i>misery, nay, should develop <i>metta </i>without 
          causing misery to others.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">After developing metta towards one's own 
          self taking one from the outstanding example cited above, metta is to 
          be developed towards either a teacher who is worthy of love and respect, 
          or towards the grandfather, father, uncle, etc. Or, in the case of females, 
          towards the grandma, mother, aunt and so on. The manner of developing 
          metta may be described as: "May the Sayadaw be happy and free from 
          misery. Or, "May the grandfather, father, and uncle be happy. (In 
          the case of females) "May the grandma, mother and aunt be happy 
          and free from suffering and misery." In this way, metta should 
          be developed about once ever three seconds. <i>Metta c</i>an also be 
          developed towards any other person deserving of affection and respect, 
          if not towards your teacher, grandparents, mother, father and so on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The mind should be bent upon the recipient 
          of metta, loving-kindness, whoever he may be, and then transmit this 
          feeling of metta as "May he be happy" for hundred times (thousand, 
          ten thousand and hundred thousand times) continuously. If one's objective 
          is for the achievement of <i>jhana-samadhi, metta</i> should be developed 
          all throughout day and night without a break excluding the time for 
          sleep as an interval for a respite. While developing, the mind may flirt. 
          These wandering thoughts are <i>akusala</i> demerits, known as <i>nivaranas</i>. 
          The moment you become mindful of such </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">thoughts 
          or imaginations, these should be rejected, and then, continue to go 
          on developing metta, continuously. When the power of concentration, 
          samadhi becomes strong, such wandering thoughts will gradually lessen. 
          If <i>samadhi </i>is fully<i> </i>strengthened, the mind will cease 
          to wander and remain fixed on the person to whom metta is transmitted. 
          This is the realisation of <i>upacara-samadhi </i>which is free from 
          <i>nivaranas.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When this <i>upacara-sarnadhi </i>becomes 
          strong and keen, the mind will dwell fixedly on the recipient of <i>metta 
          </i>if it is drifting and floating along the stream of sensations in 
          a dream. However, the mind may stay on only for a moment in the first 
          instance. When continuous development of mindfulness on <i>metta </i>is<i>
</i>further carried on, it may stay put on the sense-object for a duration 
          of one minute or more, up to even one hour or so.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">When thus, absorbed in mindfulness of 
          <i>metta </i>despite the environmental effects of sensational objects, 
          the mind </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">does not make short flights 
          to these sensations but will remain firm, stable and gets implanted 
          on the person who receives the <i>metta </i>wishing him happiness. Rapturous 
          feeling will also become conspicuous. <i>Vitakka </i>and <i>vicara</i>, 
          reflection on the mind and investigation of what is going on with a 
          bent towards the recipient of <i>metta </i>will<i> </i>become strengthened 
          and obvious. The whole body will become evidently buoyant, light and 
          comfortable. The stabilised mind </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">becomes 
          tranquil without going astray. This tranquillity of the mind <i>(ekaggata) 
          </i>with particularly obvious manifestations of <i>vitakka, vicara, 
          piti </i>and <i>sukha </i>is<i> </i>part and parcel of the noble attributes 
          of the first<i> jhana. </i>All these noble qualities are called the 
          first <i>jhana. </i>If such an achievement is derived, it is the attainment 
          of first<i> jhana. </i>This is the reason why the Visuddhimagga has 
          said that such a person can attain <i>appanajhana </i>even while developing 
          <i>metta </i>using the expression - <i>"Evarupe ca puggale kamam 
          appana sampajjati."</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">This first<i> jhana </i>having imbibed 
          or included the attributes of <i>vitakka </i>which reflects on the sensation, 
          and of <i>vicara </i>which investigates into the nature of sensation, 
          is not as strong and vigorous as it should be. Even in the course of 
          absorption in <i>jhana, </i>if harsh sounds and shrill voices strike 
          the ear-base of the sensation of hearing, the mind-consciousness may 
          rise from <i>jhana </i>-and then reaches the sound which is the sense-object. 
          That is why <i>metta </i>should be repeatedly developed towards the 
          person on whom the mind is usually made to dwell, to create the tranquil 
          "<i>Jhanic-mind</i>" without inclusion of <i>vitakka </i>and 
          vicara. When <i>samadhi </i>gets strengthened extreme joy or rapture 
          together with the calmness of the mind which are far more increasingly 
          better, will occur without making effort to let the mind inclined and 
          reflected towards the sensation, and also without making investigation 
          into that sensation. This is the achievement of second<i> jhana. At 
          </i>the moment of absorption in a trance of that <i>jhana, </i>intense 
          delight or ecstasy is of the highest degree. If this extremely rapturous 
          feeling - piti is not desirable, continuous development and transmission 
          of <i>metta </i>should be made towards the usual recipient of <i>metta, 
          </i>When concentration gets fully developed and strengthened, excellent 
          mental happiness and tranquillity of mind without rapture <i>(piti) 
          will </i>become obvious. That is the third <i>jhana. </i>This <i>jhana 
          is </i>the most. exalted or the highest <i>jhana </i>among <i>metta-jhana.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Either after achieving the <i>jhana </i>just 
          mentioned, or, before achievement of that <i>jhana, </i>if it is desirable 
          to develop <i>metta </i>equally balanced towards all beings, it may 
          be developed and radiated on the most affectionate person as "may 
          such one be happy, etc." It would be much better to develop and 
          transmit <i>metta </i>after the attainment of <i>jhana </i>rather than 
          before the attainment. Purified form of <i>metta </i>can occur easily. 
          Hence, after <i>metta-jhana </i>has been achieved in respect of the 
          most affectionate person, development of <i>metta </i>may be made directing 
          towards, or in favour of a neutral person. After such an achievement 
          of <i>jhana </i>for the sake of a neutral person, <i>metta </i>may be 
          developed and bestowed upon a person who is an enemy, if there is any. 
          In radiating <i>metta </i>towards different recipients one after another, 
          different kinds of feeling or mental consciousness <i>of metta </i>should 
          be developed only after firm and gentle mind has been brought about 
          and cherished. This is what the Visuddhimagga has stated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The statement that the mind or mental 
          consciousness has been brought about to become or and gentle, in fact, 
          refers to the acquirement <i>of upacara-samadhi </i>in the least. The 
          best method is to change the course of developing <i>metta </i>only 
          after achieving the <i>jhana. </i>Of all the various expressions, the 
          statement: <i>"Metta </i>should be developed towards any enemy" 
          is intended for the Yogi who has an enemy. Therefore, from the very 
          outset, I have stated as: "... a person who is an enemy, if there 
          is any." A Yogi, if he has no enemy, should not bother about the 
          enemy in developing <i>metta </i>after he has developed loving-kindness 
          towards a neutral person.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Anger is likely to occur, remembering 
          the wrong done by a person who is an enemy, while a Yogi is developing 
          <i>metta </i>towards him. When such an incident happens, <i>metta-jhana 
          </i>which has been previously achieved in respect of any other person 
          beforehand may be recalled and repeatedly plunged in; and then, by developing 
          <i>metta </i>towards this particular enemy after rousing up, off and 
          on, from the mental state of absorption in <i>jhana, </i>he should dispel 
          or extinguish the fiery anger. In regard to those expressions, since 
          the Visuddhimagga has stated as: <i>"Mettam samapajjitva vutthahitva", 
          </i>it is clear. enough that <i>metta-jhana </i>has been attained in 
          respect of other person except the enemy. Hence, I have stated that 
          developing <i>metta </i>by shifting on to another after attainment of 
          <i>jhana </i>in respect of the former person, is the best.</font></p>

<font size="3">(22) </font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">Method 
          of reflection to subdue anger</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">After repeatedly absorbing in <i>jhana 
          </i>that has been realised in radiating <i>metta </i>to persons mentioned 
          in the foregoing, and then, by developing <i>metta </i>towards an enemy 
          after arising from that <i>jhana, </i>if<i> </i>the anger cannot as 
          yet be totally eradicated or repressed, advice is given to extinguish 
          the burning anger by reflecting and bearing in mind the exhortation 
          that has been made by the Buddha citing a saw as an example, etc. The 
          manner of reflection to be done is:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Oh, my dear indignant Yogi! Is it 
          not true that the Exalted One has given exhortation as - 0, monk! If 
          one, (for having suffered badly in the hands of the bandits, robbers 
          and dacoits by being cruelly deprived of his bodily limbs, such as, 
          hands and feet which have been cut off with a double-edged saw fixed 
          with a handle at both ends), gets angry and has done wrong in retaliation 
          against the villains who have ill-treated him, is, I say, a recalcitrant 
          resisting my due admonition".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Next, if retaliation is made in anger 
          on provocation against a person in whom anger has first arisen or started, 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">the raging anger which subsequently 
          takes place in another as a reaction, is worse than the anger that has 
          first occurred. (It is because the person who later becomes angry has 
          knowingly followed the wrong footsteps of the first man who gets angry). 
          Is it not true, as admonished by the Buddha, that a person who can tolerate 
          an angry man refraining him ' self from getting angry, is a victor in 
          battle which is hard to be won?"</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">And then, it has also been preached that 
          if<i> </i>a Bhikkhu, who can remain calm or in mental peace without 
          being angry although fully aware of the fact that the other (who provokes) 
          is in an angry mood, may be said to be a disciplined person for the 
          benefit of himself as well as for the benefit of the other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Furthermore, putting it in a nutshell, 
          out of the seven kinds (of behaviour) which the enemy would be pleased 
          to see, the first is (1) a change in the facial expression of an angry 
          person whose looks suddenly becomes ugly. This is one which the enemy 
          would find it agreeable. (2) A person who is inflamed with anger will 
          not have a sound and peaceful sleep. This is also one of the liking 
          of the enemy. (3) A person heated with anger is likely to lose his business 
          deal which might be adversely affected. This is one which an enemy will 
          find it amusing. (4) A person who is dominated by anger may be lacking 
          in riches, or rather, may not have enough of wealth and possessions. 
          This too is one which an enemy likes to see. (5) A person who is of 
          a fiery nature and is prone to vehement anger is likely to have a shortage 
          in the number of personal attendants or retinue. An enemy is rejoiced 
          to find such a state of condition. (6) A person of anger will not have 
          a wide circle of friends. This also brings delight to an enemy. (7) 
          A person who is sensitive to anger and is furious cannot possibly be 
          reborn in <i>sugati</i> (an existence where happy conditions prevail) 
          after his death. The gist of this admonition is the advice given to 
          nurture the spirit of patience by repelling the force of anger so that 
          the liking or the wishes of the enemy may not be fulfilled.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Next, is it not also true that teachings 
          has been made thus: "Just as the firewood which is used in. disposing 
          of corpses by burning at the time of cremation, is worthless for use 
          in both the rural and urban areas, a Bhikkhu who is avaricious and committing 
          vices with anger and malice being deprived of both the benefits of enjoying 
          sensual pleasures <i>(kamaguna), </i>and of the accomplishment of morality, 
          will not be worthy of respect and will serve no useful purpose in the 
          role of a Bhikkhu both in towns and villages, i.e. in urban and rural 
          areas."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In view of the above facts, if you, a 
          Yogi, is in anger, you will be regarded as a person who is disobedient 
          to the noble instructions given by the Exalted One. You will be like 
          a vanquished, in a battle which is difficult of winning a victory, and 
          will also be more vicious than the person who initially becomes angry 
          with iniquity. One should therefore reflect and think over seriously 
          by teaching and reforming himself, and then, exercise over his anger.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If by reflecting as such, anger cannot 
          as yet be suppressed or extinguished, do not think of and ponder upon 
          the bad behaviours of the enemy, but instead, let your anger subside 
          by reflecting on' the good points in his physical, mental and verbal 
          behaviours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">And still, if by reflection as stated, 
          feeling of anger cannot as yet be subdued, reflect upon what is going 
          to be stated now, and put out this fiery anger which has arisen. The 
          manner of reflection is only mentioned in the Visuddhimagga and is not 
          to be found in other Pali Atthakathas. The relevant verses are exactly 
          ten in number. I shall continue on and explain these verses very briefly.</font></p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="3">The manner of reflection according 
          to the Ten Verses</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(1) In the case of an enemy wishing to 
          cause misery and suffering, injury can only be inflicted by him on your 
          physical body. No harm can be done against the mind. In spite of this 
          why do you want to do things to the liking of the enemy and cause mental 
          distress, which the enemy himself is incapable of doing?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(2) Why can't you discard or reject the 
          anger which is likely to bring disastrous effects and no beneficial 
          results, despite the fact that you have donned the yellow robes and 
          have become a Bhikkhu after abandoning all your friends capable of giving 
          you a lot of advantages?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(3) Why do you entertain and caress the 
          spiteful anger which is capable of wiping or chucking out fear and shame, 
          patience, loving-kindness and compassion, which are the basic fundamentals 
          of morality (<i>sila</i>), which you have personally observed? Where 
          can such a fool as you are, be found? It means to say that you are the 
          most silly person since you have entertained the anger which can destroy 
          and root out your own morality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(4) You are angry against another for 
          having done wrong to you. Is it not true then, that you who have so 
          become angry, is plotting to offend him in the same manner as has been 
          done to you, in retaliation?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(5) it is most likely that any disagreeable 
          act done to you by another is to stir up your anger, or rather, to make 
          you angry. Such being the case, is it not true that by yielding to your 
          anger, it would amount to fulfilling the desire of another person?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(6) It is not quite sure that you who 
          are angry, will definitely make your enemy miserable. Hence, is it not 
          true that even now, at present, you are ill-treating yourself by stirring 
          up anger and causing misery to yourself?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(7) As the enemies are foolishly following 
          the path of vice which is unprofitable, as provoked by anger, will there 
          be any justification for you to commit wrongful acts out of anger following 
          the footsteps of your enemies?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(8) If any detestable and disagreeable 
          deed is done to you by your enemy based upon anger, you should dispel 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">or overcome this anger. As a matter 
          of fact, why do you unnecessarily cause strain to yourself with an angry 
          feeling towards an individual human being who is not deserving of spite 
          and hatred. (It means that you have done something wrong only at the 
          dictates of "anger" to whom you have become a slave.) Hence, 
          this anger itself needs to be rejected".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>(9) Rupa </i>and <i>nama</i>, matter 
          and mind, are transient by nature and are occurring only for a moment, 
          followed by dissolution instantaneously. Such <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama 
          </i>which are seemingly thought as having done wrong to you, have already 
          dissolved into thin air in an instant. These <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama 
          </i>are no longer there. They have disappeared altogether. Thus, at 
          the present could you pinpoint that 'matter and mind' in the person 
          of the enemy with which you are angry? New <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas 
          </i>which have subsequently occurred are not doing any wrongful act 
          or harm to you. Those which are considered as having done harm to you 
          have vanished. Hence, there is no meaning in being angry with <i>rupa 
          </i>and <i>nama. </i>(It means to say that <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>with 
          which you are quarrelling no longer exist).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">(10) If one is causing misery to the other, 
          both the doer himself and the one who suffers are the prime factors, 
          which bring about or produce the effect of misery. In other words, both 
          of them are responsible for the causation of misery. If that is so, 
          since you yourself are not free from blame for the cause of misery, 
          why are you angry with the 'doer' only</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The above is the summarised statement 
          of the ten verses - gathers, translated in plain language, as mentioned 
          in the Visuddhimagga. The manner of reflection laid down therein is 
          extremely profound. Reflection may therefore be made as stated to extinguish 
          the flame of anger.</font></p>

          </font><font face="Arial" size="3">How to subdue anger by reflecting 
          on Kamma as one's own property in possession</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If by reflection as indicated in the ten 
          verses, anger cannot as yet be subdued or extinguished, it should be 
          reflected upon <i>kamma, </i>the resultant effects of all good and bad 
          actions done by you, as your own property in possession on which reliance 
          is to be made to eradicate the anger. The manner of reflection may be 
          stated thus: "Oh Yogi you are developing the practice of <i>metta 
          bhavana. </i>While being angry what is your intention to do against 
          the other? Is it not true that, whatever action, you have done based 
          upon anger will in consequence, bring about evil or bad effects to your 
          detriment? Yes, indeed. Your <i>kamma </i>(the resultant effects of 
          good and bad actions you have done) is nothing but the 'cause' of your 
          own doing. <i>Kamma </i>is the only one which you really own or possess. 
          You are sure to inherit this <i>kamma </i>which constitutes all kinds 
          of wilful actions, whether mental, verbal or physical; thoughts, words 
          and deeds, either good or bad, done by you on your own volition. <i>Kamma 
          </i>is your own relative and refuge. The kammic effect which occurs 
          or takes place depending upon anger will not con tribute to your achieving 
          <i>magga-phala. </i>Neither will it do good to you to be reborn in the 
          world of humans and Devas where happy condition's prevail. It will not 
          render help but will only cause you to suffer misery. in hell, etc. 
          If you commit the evil <i>kamma </i>of anger, it will be like "a 
          person who first suffers the burns and gets awfully dirty by holding 
          and carrying in his hands the burning hot coal, and disgusting filth 
          or excrements, with which he is going to cause injury and misery to 
          the other."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Just imagine a person whom you recognise 
          as an enemy. What harm could possibly be done by him with his anger? 
          Will not this anger that is generated in him be to his own disadvantage? 
          He too has his own <i>kamma </i>(action - moral and immoral volition) 
          as his real estate. He is the inheritor of his own <i>kamma </i>done 
          by himself on his own volition, etc. The enemy who has done evil <i>kamma 
          </i>by being angry, will suffer its harmful effects 'Just as a person 
          on whom the dust will fall back by the force of wind if he sprinkles 
          or throws the dust to shower upon another man, standing against the 
          wind on the leeward side from an adverse position." The Buddha 
          has therefore exhorted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"If a certain fool commits wrong 
            against a noble person of purified conduct, this wrong doing will 
            react upon him as a retribution, etc.</font></p>

          was exercised by Khantivadi, a great hermit</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At one time in the ancient days, during 
          the reign of King Kalabu in the city of Benares, the Bodhisatta, born 
          of a high caste Brahmin, was a multimillionaire possessing eighty crores 
          of rupees. When his parents died leaving behind all their wealth and 
          properties, it had occurred to him that his parents were unable to take 
          along with them what they physically owned on their demise, though they 
          were able to accumulate immense wealth. On his part, considering that 
          he should take them with him on his death, he generously gave away all 
          his possessions in charity to those who deserved. Thereafter, he went 
          into a retreat in one of the forested areas of the Himalayas assuming 
          the role of a hermit. He lived only on fruits which were available in 
          the forest. There was however, no salt for consumption. In order, therefore, 
          to have proper and adequate nourishment, he made his way to villages 
          where there were people, to procure salt and sour fruits for his own 
          personal consumption. Eventually, he reached the city of Benares. When 
          going round for alms in the city, the Commander-in-Chief of they finding 
          him worthy of reverence, respectfully invited him to his residence to 
          accept the offer of meals. Later, he was requested to reside in the 
          pleasance of the king's royal garden. This request was accepted by him. 
          He continued to stay in that royal garden as his place of retreat.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">While he was so residing on one day, King 
          Kalabu visited the royal garden in the company of his queen and maids-of-honour 
          together with a large retinue to hold a ceremonious function. The ceremony 
          was held comprising a series of performances of music, ballet, etc., 
          on a magnificent and spacious marble slab within the precincts of the 
          royal garden. The king enjoyed the festivities watching the display 
          of music, songs and dances after taking a lying posture with his head 
          resting on the thigh of a damsel whom he adored. Merry-making including 
          the dance with accompanying music formed part of the celebrations taken 
          part by professional artistes and maids-of-honour from the royal palace. 
          While listening to the soft music, the sweet melody had lulled the king 
          to sleep. Finding the king in deep slumber, the troupe of female singers 
          and dancers stopped playing music for a moment and roamed about the 
          garden sight-seeing. While thus making a rambling excursion, they came 
          across the great hermit, the Bodhisatta. They then approached him wishing 
          to listen to the preaching which he might be inclined to give. At their 
          request, the great hermit delivered a sermon appropriate to the occasion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At that time the maid-of-honour on whose 
          thigh the king had rested his royal head, manoeuvred her limbs to wake 
          up the king. The king when aroused from his sleep found none of his 
          retinue and maids near him. When inquired as to where they had gone 
          to, the maid whose thigh had served as a cushion for the king's head, 
          answered that the whole crowd had gone to the great hermit. On hearing 
          the news, the royal monarch became furious with jealousy. He then picked 
          up his sword and hurried his way to the hermit, uttering with an uncontrollable 
          anger that he would give the hermit a good lesson.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Seeing the king raging with anger, one 
          of the maids-of-honour close to him caught hold of his sword and tried 
          to calm him down. However, King Kalabu's anger remained, uncontrollable, 
          he asked the hermit what was the Doctrine which he, the hermit, professed. 
          The great hermit replied that his tenet was the Doctrine of <i>khanti 
          </i>(patience), saying that tolerance, exercised by one without feeling 
          angry against those who provoked, railed and raved, is called "patience". 
          The king then telling the hermit that he would put him to a crucial 
          test to find out if he was really accomplished with patience, ordered 
          his servant, the Executioner, in this manner. "You better pull 
          down this villainous thief, the hermit, lay him prostrate on the ground 
          and punish him with two-thousand lashes by whipping with a twisted cane 
          fixed with sharp-pointed pins, on all four sides of his body."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The executioner gave the hermit two-thousand 
          lashes as ordered by the king. Ordinarily, a person would surely succumb 
          to the injuries received if he has to undergo a penalty of 2,000 lashes. 
          Curiously, the great hermit was found still alive, possibly because 
          of his noble qualities of <i>khanti </i>or of relaxed or slack force 
          put in at the time of whipping - no one can say. However, the thick 
          outer and inner thin layer of skin covering the flesh of the entire 
          body of the hermit was grievously torn. Flesh was also torn to bits. 
          Blood flowed out profusely. Just imagine how severe the pain and suffering 
          would be that the said hermit had to undergo. In spite of this ferocious 
          ill-treatment, the great noble hermit harboured no anger, ill-will or 
          grudge either against the king or the executioner. This is the cruel 
          punishment imposed without rhyme or reason or fault whatsoever. Ordinarily, 
          such a treatment would induce anger and malicious feeling. This kind 
          of patience indeed calls for the spirit of emulation from Yogis who 
          are developing <i>metta.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Finding the great hermit still alive, 
          the king asked him what doctrine he was practising. Thereupon, the Reverend 
          Hermit replied, "I firmly hold the Doctrine of Patience 0, King, 
          do you think that this 'patience' <i>(khanti) </i>can be traced in the 
          skin of my body? It is not underneath the layers of the skin. 'Patience' 
          resides in my heart of hearts and never runs out. Infuriated by this 
          mental attitude, King KaIabu ordered that two hands of the hermit be 
          cut off and also that the lower extremities - the two feet, the ears, 
          and the nose be sliced off. The Executioner strictly complied with the 
          king's orders and cruelly cut off those bodily limbs with an axe. Every 
          time a limb was severed, a question was put as to what was the kind 
          of Doctrine accepted by the hermit. The reply given by the great hermit 
          repeatedly to the questions, was the same as before, that he had held 
          firmly to the doctrine of patience which found its abode in his heart. 
          Eventually, the king after uttering in disgust as: "You cunning 
          hermit. Better live on invoking or hoisting your own <i>khanti </i>foully<i>
</i>kicked the hermit in the breast with his foot and then departed. 
          After his departure, when he reached the gate of the royal garden, this 
          King Kalabu was swallowed down by the earth. It has been mentioned in 
          the Atthakatha (Commentary) that this wicked king was dragged down to 
          Avici - hell, enveloped in burning flames.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Thereafter, the Commander-in-Chief of 
          the army came over to the great hermit and tendered his apology not 
          to feel angry and bear malice against the State (country). Thereupon, 
          the Reverend Hermit gave his reply as follows:</font></p>

            nasal ca cheddar.<br/>

<font size="3">(27) </font></font><font face="Arial" size="3">The Story 
          of Dhammapala, the young lad</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At one time in the past old days, Mahapatapa 
          was the ruling monarch in the country of Benares. At that time Bodhisatta 
          entered the womb of the chief queen Canda Devi who later gave birth 
          to a son. Bodhisatta, the newly born baby was given the name of Dhammapala. 
          When this young prince Dhammapala was seven months old, his mother, 
          the queen, after bathing her child and dressing him with fine costumes, 
          was caressing and jovially playing with the infant with love. At that 
          moment, the queen whose joyous thoughts were momentarily riveted on 
          her bonny son, being so delighted that she failed to get up and pay 
          respect to her husband, the king, who had by then come over to the place 
          where the mother was molly-coddling the child.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The king on seeing the mother fondling 
          her son, imagined, "Even now this woman is becoming swell headed 
          and conceited, relying on her son. When the child become a grown-up, 
          it is almost certain that she will surely neglect me. Perhaps, it would 
          be better to get rid of the son now." With a feeling of disappointment 
          which had reflected on his facial expression, he left the place and 
          proceeded to his royal chamber where the throne had stood. He immediately 
          sent for the Executioner and gave orders that the infant child be brought 
          before his presence. Judging from his looks from the very outset, the 
          queen knew that her husband, the king, had entertained his resentment 
          against her. Realising this unhappy state of affairs, the queen was 
          shedding tears while folding the baby to her breasts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">While she was thus weeping, the Executioner 
          appeared and snatched away the child Dhammapala from her. She followed 
          from behind the Executioner with a pensive mood. On their arrival before 
          the king, the child was put on a wooden slab. Orders were immediately 
          given by the king to chop off the hands of the poor little unfortunate 
          child. The queen Canda Devi entreated the king that the child was innocent 
          and that only she had the fault. She pleaded repeatedly that her hands 
          be cut off instead of the hands of her innocent soil but to no avail. 
          The Executioner had to obey and execute the orders of the king. The 
          hands of the seven months' old infant Dhammapala were therefore cruelly 
          chopped off with an axe. The two small tender hands were dismembered 
          as if a delicate sprout of a bamboo plant is severed. The young infant, 
          Bodhisatta, however, did not flinch or cry but remained still with patience. 
          Hence, the commentary goes to say:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">So - This young child Dhammapala, <i>hatthesu 
          chijjamanesu - </i>when<i> </i>cut off his hands, i.e. while his hands 
          were chopped off, <i>nevarodi </i>- neither uttered a cry, <i>na parideyi 
          - </i>nor wailed or lamented, <i>khantinca </i>- exercising the spirit 
          of patience, and, <i>mettinca - </i>wishing happiness to the other, 
          <i>purecarikam katva - </i>guided by the thoughts of lovingkindness, 
          <i>adhivasesi </i>endured the pain and suffering by resigning himself 
          to the situation (fate).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The mother - queen Canda Devi after picking 
          up the soft tiny hands that had been severed, folded them close to her 
          bosom and was bitterly sobbing. Thereafter, the father Mahapatapa king 
          again ordered the Executioner to out off the two feet and then, the 
          head of the child. The queen went on retreating her husband to pardon 
          the innocent child but to no purpose. The Executioner then severed the 
          child's head as ordered by the king and even tossed up the little delicate 
          body of the child in the air and on falling down, caught it up with 
          the sharp-pointed sword and played with it as if it were a wreath of 
          flowers. It is almost unbelievable that there was such. kind of foolish, 
          wicked and heartless father without a tinge of mercy in him. However, 
          there is every possibility of finding such a merciless man from among 
          the worldly people when one becomes a slave to "Anger". Because 
          of this possibility, the case of this wicked King Mahapatapa, father 
          of Dhammapala, has been cited as an example. The queen died of a broken-heart 
          on the spot while weeping and wailing. By a curious coincidence, King 
          Mahapatapa also fell down from his throne and dropped on to the floor 
          first, and eventually reached the level of the earth below where he 
          was swallowed down to death. It was stated that he had gone down to 
          <i>avici </i>hell, one of the eight <i>Narakas.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">As for the young child Dhammapala, it 
          was stated that he passed away peacefully while exercising patience 
          without any anger which had not arisen till the time of his death. Considering 
          this episode, it might be possible for a Yogi who is developing metta 
          to endure pain and suffering without being angry, just as the young 
          child Dhammapala had practised forbearance.</font></p>

          of practising patience by Chaddanta</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Mention is made in the Visuddhimagga to 
          reflect as to how patience was exercised by Chaddanta, the King of the 
          Elephants, our Bodhisatta in one of his previous existences, without 
          anger and ill-will when Sonothe, a hunter, shot at him with a poisonous 
          arrow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Mahakapi, a huge monkey once saved the 
          life of a man who had accidentally fallen into a deep, ravine. After 
          having been rescued from the danger of death, this man cruelly struck 
          the head of his Saviour with a big stone when the latter had fallen 
          asleep through exhaustion. However, the noble-minded monkey bore no 
          resentment and grudge against him and even rendered his assistance to 
          this man by escorting him to reach the zone of safety where human beings 
          lived.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Then also, there were instances of two 
          Bodhisatta dragons - one by the name of Buridatta, and the other, Campeyya, 
          a Naga Chief, who were captured alive and ill-treated by a snake-charmer, 
          while they were observing the noble precepts (<i>sila</i>). The snake-charmer 
          took these snakedragons (<i>Nagas</i>) to towns and villages where he 
          displayed an exhibition of these two noble creatures making them dance 
          to the tune of music played by him. These Nagas possessed inherent supernatural 
          powers and were so highly poisonous and potent that by just looking 
          at the persons with spite and omitting fiery flames, people would be 
          reduced to ashes or killed. However; the said two Nagas endured the 
          misery brought about by their enemy, the snake-charmer. The manner in 
          which they practised patience refraining themselves from anger, may 
          be reflected, as explained in the Visuddhimagga.</font></p>

          patience through mindfulness as exampled by Ven. Ponna</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">At one time, Venerable Ponna, a native 
          of Sunaparanta country, entreated the Exalted One to deliver a teaching 
          to him in a concise way. The Buddha, therefore, taught him as below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"0, my son Ponna! There are pleasurable 
          and agreeable sights and scenes, or sense-objects which can be perceived 
          and known by the eyes. These pleasurable sense-objects are also concerned 
          with one's own desires. They are also prone to sensuous attachments. 
          If the sense-objects or <i>rupa</i> that come into your view, are accepted 
          with pleasure and looked upon as being agreeable with admiration, or 
          are embraced and grasped or retained in your possession, it would cause 
          rejoicing in you, called "<i>Nandi</i>". 0, my son Ponna! 
          I say that misery will take place because of this delight and pleasure." 
          (Similarly, teachings were given in respect of the sensations of sound, 
          smell, taste, touch and thoughts.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"0, my son Ponna! The way to end 
          misery, or rather, to make misery come to a cessation is not to accept 
          or entertain the different sensations arising from different sense-objects 
          which will cause to generate a feeling of delight and pleasure. If it 
          is done so, there will be no opportunity for <i>Nandi </i>to occur. 
          0, my son Ponna! Because of the cessation of pleasurable conditions 
          and feelings, misery and suffering will entirely cease."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"0, my son Ponna! I have already 
          given due admonition to you in a brief manner. You, who have heard and 
          received this admonition may now let me know the place where you are 
          going to reside." To this query, Ven. Ponna replied: "My Lord, 
          I'm residing in Sunaparanta state in the westernmost part of the Continent 
          of India, which is called Jambudipa</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"0, my son Ponna! The citizens of 
          Sunaparanta are rude, rough and petulant. If they scold you land utter 
          abusive words at you, how would you feel.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">"My Lord, if they abuse and rail 
          at me, I would bear in mind in this manner: 0, these citizens of Sunaparanta 
          are not at all bad. They only utter abusive words and rebuke, and have 
          not yet made any physical assault on me,'" answered Ven. Ponna.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Buddha further interrogated him as: "If 
          they give you a beating and attack you physically, how would you feel?" 
          He then replied, "I would forbear it with a feeling of tolerance 
          that Sunaparanta citizens are only doing harm to </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">me 
          with their hands. Since they have not caused injury to me by throwing 
          stones<i> </i>at me, they will be considered as having conducted themselves 
          fairly well." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Questions then followed as to how Ven. 
          Ponna would react or respond if he </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">were 
          assaulted physically with stones, sticks, and swords <i>(dahs) </i>not 
          to the extent of causing him death. The reply given to every question 
          put was that he would tolerate and consider them as not behaving badly. 
          Then the question arose as to how he would bear in mind and feel if 
          he were killed by being cut with a <i>dah. </i>The response given was 
          that having heard of an incident, where some of the Bhikkhus from among 
          the disciples of the Lord Buddha had even got to find for a lethal weapon 
          such as a <i>dah </i>to commit suicide for being disgusted with their 
          own material body and life existence, he would reflect on the said incident 
          and consider himself lucky enough to be killed by another person without 
          the need to look for a lethal weapon - a <i>dah - which </i>can cause 
          death.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">This Venerable Ponna later made his way 
          to Sunaparanta country and carried on practising meditation. He was 
          said to have become an Arahat even before the end of his first Vassa.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">As such, there is every likelihood of 
          a Yogi to be able to extinguish his anger by reflecting on the manner 
          in which Venerable Ponna had borne in mind or his mental attitude, as 
          cited in this Sutta.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">If anger cannot as yet be exterminated 
          by reflecting on the noble attributes and moral conduct of the Bodhisatta, 
          the Visuddhimagga has stated<b> </b>that the eleven advantages of <i>metta 
          </i>should be reflected as has been enumerated earlier. 0, Yogis, if 
          you are developing <i>metta </i>and cannot dispel this 'anger' by so 
          doing, you should clear it by reflecting that you would otherwise lose 
          all the advantages of <i>metta.</i></font></p>

          Are you getting angry with his hair on the head, or against his urine? 
          Putting it in another way, since the hair is made up of four constituents 
          viz: the elements of earth, water, fire and air, are you angry with 
          <i>pathavidhatu, </i>or <i>apodhatu,</i> or<i> tejodhatu, </i>or <i>vayodhatu?

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Are you angry with the <i>rupa, </i>matter,

          to this rule of discipline, the attitude of the old Thera amounted to 
          causing annoyance to Pindapatika Thera. With a view to expel the feeling 
          of vengeance borne by the other, Pindapatika Thera offered the other 
          a bowl stating: "Sir, this is the begging bowl worth eight kyats 
          which my mother had donated<b> </b>to me. You may please accept it and 
          make use of it so that my mother, the donor, will derive merits." 
          Since the time of acceptance of the gift of the said bowl, feeling of 
          animosity and vengeance had totally subsided in the old Thera. Hence, 
          the Commentators have stated:</font></p>
<ul>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="-1">"Adantadamanam danam, danam 
            sabbatthasadhakam, Danena piyavacaya, unnamani namanti ca.</font></i></p>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>Danam - </i>charity<i> </i>or act of 
          alms-giving, <i>adantadamanam - </i>can make a rude person become civilised, 
          or in other words, can tame an unruly person. <i>Danam - </i>the act 
          of donating gifts, <i>sabbatthasadhakam - </i>will accomplish all the 
          advantages, or rather, will carry with it full benefits. (In the Silakkhanda 
          Commentary, it is stated as <i>"adinam dantadusakam" </i>which, 
          in fact, conveys the meaning that if a person worthy of receiving the 
          offer of donation is not given a gift, it could - bring about estrangement 
          between him and a refined person who is friendly to him and has earned 
          his respect.) It continues to say that by offering gifts with a feeling 
          of generosity and by speaking sweetly in a gentle manner, the person 
          who makes offerings with a sweet tongue will be enhanced in his prestige. 
          And also, the relationship between the receiver of gifts who hears the 
          talk and the giver who speaks, will be cordial and in harmony.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">As stated in the foregoing, if anger which 
          has arisen against an enemy, or rather, a hostile person, has subsided 
          or been suppressed, feeling of <i>metta </i>or loving-kindness will 
          also constantly occur in such a hostile person just as the feeling of 
          <i>metta </i>occurs in respect of (1) an affectionate person worthy 
          of respect and love, (2) a beloved person or a person on whom deep love 
          is bestowed, (3) a neutral person who is neither dear nor hateful. At 
          the same time while developing <i>metta </i>repeatedly, this loving-kindness 
          shall be transmitted to all four kinds of persons, viz: his own self, 
          the one whom he dearly loves, the neutral person, and the hostile person 
          with his equally balanced mind put on each and every one of them by 
          inculcating a spirit of goodwill, wishing them happiness. By so doing, 
          it would amount to avoiding discrimination between different kinds of 
          persons to whom goodwill is to be imparted equally wishing them happiness. 
          This is called <i>"Simasambheda" </i>In other words, the line 
          of demarcation drawn, or, the boundary marked out between different 
          individuals should be erased.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">The manner of cancelling out or nullifying 
          the limit of differentiation between individuals is:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Let us say that a person who is developing 
          <i>metta </i>together with the person who deserves love, i.e. one who 
          is dear to him, the neutral person, and the enemy (a hostile person), 
          all four of them, are living in the same place; and </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">let's 
          assume that while living together as stated, a number of villains and 
          thieves came over and asked the person </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">developing 
          <i>metta </i>with an ultimatum to hand over to them any one of the four, 
          so as to enable them to offer him as a </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">sacrifice 
          to propitiate a god in the performance of a ritual. When demanded as 
          such, if a wavering thought arises </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">imagining 
          as to which of the four persons should be offered, it will not yet amount 
          to achievement of the quality of </font><font face="Arial" size="-1"><i>simasambheda. 
          </i>It is simply because it would be tantamount to discrimination or 
          denying the interests of the person </font><font face="Arial" size="-1">(victim), 
          who is chosen to be taken away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In reality, only if a feeling of loving-kindness 
          occurs, spreading out <i>metta </i>equally on all four persons including 
          himself, wishing each and every one to be happy, without wishing to 
          hand over anyone of the four, then, it is said to have amounted to <i>simasambheda. 
          </i>It means that no distinction has been made between himself and others. 
          There will only be one sphere of activity which is confined solely to 
          bringing about happiness, and this means that there is no such distinguishing 
          limit (known as <i>Sima</i>), which is, in fact, cancelled out.</font></p>

          continues practising by developing several times the sensation arising

          is according to what has been stated in the Visuddhimagga. This <i>appana-jhana

          will be given based fundamentally on the Metta Sutta, which is quite 
          familiar to a majority of the people here. The Metta Sutta is of paramount 
          importance for the Buddhists in Burma. It has become an indispensable 
          Sutta when reciting prayers and various kinds of hymns or incantations 
          (<i>parittas</i>) which are usually chanted at religious functions to 
          ward off the influence of evil spirits and impart loving-kindness to

          by the benefactors who are donors. It is, therefore, necessary for the 
          Bhikkhus (monks) to seriously study the text so as to grasp the meaning 
          and significance of the Metta Sutta. Practice should be made so as to 
          be able to recite this Sutta correctly and precisely with a smooth flow 
          and without making any errors. Then, while reciting this Sutta, metta 
          should also be developed. So by developing metta in this way it will

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          one time, while the Lord Buddha was residing at Jetavana monastery in 
          the city of Savatthi, five hundred Bhikkhus, after taking instructions 
          from the Buddha on the method of practising Kammatthana meditation, 
          went out in search of a suitable monastery and a village where alms-givers 
          or donors could be found. They then reached a mountain where lakes were 
          in abundance at the fringe of the Himalayas. The place was clean and 
          refreshingly cool and peaceful. They stayed for one night at this place. 
          Early the next morning, they visited a village in the neighbourhood 
          to seek for alms. It was stated that this village was fairly large with 
          one thousand dwelling houses. The villagers being generous and hospitable 
          offered meals to all five hundred Bhikkhus and also requested them to 
          spend their Vassa at their place. They also donated a small monastery 
          to all of the Bhikkhus to enable them to live in peace and meditate 
          singly, and provided them with benches and footstools for sitting, water 
          pots, etc.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
          the following day, they proceeded to another Village. The inhabitants 
          of that village similarly requested the Bhikkhus to reside at their 
          place for a period of Vassa after they had offered<b> </b>the meals. 
          They agreed to stay as requested making a remark in passing that it 
          would be better if the place were free from dangers. Later, they carried 
          on practising meditation day and night continuously at a grove in that 
          forested area situated in close proximity to the village. Owing to the 
          influential effect of the powers of the Bhikkhus who were endowed with 
          morality (<i>sila</i>), the guardian angels of the trees in the forested 
          area dared not reside in their abodes from which they descended, taking 
          along with them their young children, and had to be moving about hither 
          and thither. The Nats or ' the deities were, therefore, watching out 
          from a good distance with embarrassment as to when these noble Bhikkhus 
          would be leaving the place.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Later, 
          it had occurred to them as: "These Bhikkhus would no doubt be staying 
          for a period of three months during the <i>Vassa </i>(Rains Retreat)<i>. 
          </i>We, with. our children, cannot possibly remain outside our abodes 
          for a long time. It would, therefore, appear advisable to create horror, 
          and dreadful sensational sights to frighten them away." implementing 
          their thoughts into action, <i>rukkha-devas, </i>the guardian Devas 
          of the trees, created themselves in the guise of ogres during night-time 
          while the Bhikkhus were meditating, and stood in the presence of the 
          Bhikkhus making, themselves visible causing weird sounds and hideous 
          noise. Having heard these uncanny sounds and seen horrible sights, the 
          Bhikkhus were all stricken with fear. Their hearts throbbed and their 
          complexion turned pale. The mind became restless with worry and fright. 
          While becoming miserable as stated, foul smell were emitted by the deities. 
          This state of condition had caused the Bhikkhus great embarrassment 
          and suffering. It was mentioned in the Commentary as <i>"Tena duggandhona 
          nimmathiyamanamiva matthalungam ahosi". </i>This expression comes very 
          close to the view of the present day Western medical doctors. It may, 
          therefore, be said that they had suffered severely from headache. Despite 
          this pain and suffering, they remained mute with great patience without 
          letting one another know about what had really happened.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
          day, on being asked by the eldest Maha Thera, each and everyone of the 
          Bhikkhus made a candid disclosure of their own respective personal experience 
          they had gone through. The eldest of the Bhikkhus, Maha Thera, then 
          expressed his opinion, "If that is the case, this place may be considered 
          as unsuitable for us to stay and continue practising meditation. Let 
          us. therefore proceed to the Lord Buddha and respectfully apprise Him 
          of this state of affairs, and then we shall shift our place of residence 
          to some other suitable spot for the rest of the period of <i>Vassa</i>. 
          Thereafter, they all came over to the Enlightened One from whom they 
          sought instruction to 'direct them to a suitable an' d proper place 
          which Would be more congenial to practise meditation.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          taking instructions from the Buddha, the Bhikkhus returned to their 
          former place in the forest, near their monastery. They stayed on in 
          that place practising meditation and reciting the Metta Sutta according 
          to the teachings of the Lord Buddha. These Devas or deities having felt 
          that "these Noble Ones are sympathetic and are really bent upon bestowing 
          upon us a lot of advantages by developing loving-kindness", were so 
          pleased and happy that they even assisted the Bhikkhus in every way 
          possible to fulfil their needs. Under these favourable circumstances, 
          all these Bhikkhus after developing <i>Metta </i>and indulging in the 
          practice of Vipassana based upon <i>metta-jhana, </i>were said to have 
          attained Arahatship reaching the stage of <i>arahattaphala </i>during 
          that period of <i>Vassa. </i>As such, at the commencement of the verse 
          eulogising the virtues of this Metta Sutta, it has been mentioned that 
          in view of the powerful influence of the noble attributes of this <i>Metta-paritta, 
          </i>the<i> </i>Guardian. Devas of the trees had refrained themselves 
          from displaying or exhibiting horrible sights and sensational objects 
          to frighten the Bhikkhus.</font></p>

          probably is to refer to the practising of Metta <i>bhavana, </i>i.e. 
          developing metta through practical meditation. It is because in the 
          Metta Sutta, where eleven advantages of <i>metta bhavana</i> are enumerated, 
          it has been elucidated that these are the advantages of <i>metta ceto

          have reference to mere requirement of recitation only. Only <i>appana-jhana 
          </i>is <i>Metta ceto vimutti</i>. This has been clearly explained in 
          the Anguttara Commentary (p. 37). Hence, if advantages, such as <i>sukham 
          supat</i>i, i.e. has the benefit of a sound sleep, etc., are desirable, 
          metta or loving-kindness meditation should also be developed in addition

          Nibbana, must invariably indulge himself in the practice of <i>sila 
          </i>(morality), <i>samadhi </i>(concentration), and <i>panna </i>(insight 
          wisdom). He must be capable of taking up this practice. What is indicated 
          by this expression is that if one wishes to be liberated from all miseries 
          and tribulations, he should have the ability to practise <i>sila, samadhi 
          </i>and <i>panna </i>without any regard for his own self or material

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
          amplify a bit more, it may be stated as resembling a worldling who, 
          realising the worldly advantages that can be derived, is striving to 
          acquire the best advantage under the given circumstances either by way 
          of earning his livelihood as an agriculturist, or a trader, or a paid 
          public servant. Just as gold, silver and other kinds of properties will 
          be of benefit to him in the pursuit of his worldly business affairs, 
          <i>sila, samadhi </i>and <i>Panna </i>are really the best advantages 
          to be gained in his long journey through <i>samsara. </i>These are the 
          essential things to be practised and acquired. In the least, if one 
          is accomplished in his <i>sila, </i>moral conduct, he will not descend 
          to the realm of <i>apaya, </i>and instead, he is. sure to reach the 
          world of human beings and of Devas, where pleasant and favourable conditions 
          prevail. If he could attain <i>jhana-samadhi, </i>he will be elevated 
          to a happy life existence in the abode of Brahmas, where the life-span 
          lasts for aeons. If one is accomplished with Vipassana insight knowledge 
          and has fully achieved <i>sotapatti magga-phala, </i>he will forever 
          be emancipated from landing in the four apayas. He will later enter 
          into <i>Parinibbana </i>on his demise after attainment of Arahatship 
          and after having been reborn in the abode of <i>sugati </i>for not more 
          than seven existences. If accomplished with <i>arahatta-magga-phala-nana, 
          </i>he will totally escape from the woes and worries of life existences, 
          i.e. there will be no more future life-existence for him. That is the 
          reason why <i>sila, samadhi </i>and <i>panna </i>are the real advantages 
          insofar as <i>samsara is </i>concerned. These attributes should be gained

          the other hand, those who have no faith in the Buddha's Dhamma will 
          not be able to practise <i>sila, samadhi </i>and <i>panna. </i>Some 
          of those who pretend to be real Buddhists have said that these practices 
          are not required to be exercised, and if practised, it will only end 
          in misery., This sort of indiscreet remark is more wishful thinking. 
          They 'are the people who have no faith or belief in the Doctrine of 
          the Buddha. Such people have no inclination to indulge themselves in 
          the practices of <i>sila, samadhi </i>and <i>panna. </i>If they fail 
          to do so, since it has been preached as <i>"karaniyam " '</i>i.e. "should 
          be practised without fail", (and) <i>"sakko" - "</i>must also have the 
          ability to practise", they shall be deemed to have held dissenting views 
          contrary to the Teachings of the Lord Buddha. As a matter of fact, they 
          are absolutely lacking in <i>sila, samadhi </i>and <i>panna, </i>just 
          like a pitiable penniless person. They are destined for the Nether World.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Moreover, unremitting 
          effort is essential. If lacking in diligence, it becomes difficult to 
          fully maintain the attributes of <i>sila </i>(morality). Thus, it will 
          be all the more burdensome to practise <i>samadhi </i>and <i>panna. 
          </i>Some are even reluctant or lazy to listen to the sermon on the subject 
          of the practice of Vipassana meditation. To a person who is diligent, 
          nothing is difficult or burdensome. He will make his relentless effort 
          to achieve fully in anything which needs to be accomplished. Hence; 
          "utmost endeavour should be made to practise for the achievement of 
          <i>sila. </i>He must have the ability to practise and perform the exercise 
          with vigour and enthusiasm. To be capable of doing so, faith and exertion 
          is essentially required to be accomplished. There fore, it is of paramount

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In

          or in other words, if a false assertion of a claim is made without actually

          will also find it difficult to mend him, or rather, put him on the right 
          lines. If one does not truly admit his faults and does not know his 
          responsibility to tell the truth, he is devoid of the quality of "<i>suhuju</i>". 
          If the mind wanders or flirts, he must openly admit as such and tell 
          what has actually happened in his exercise. Otherwise, he will not be 
          regarded as being very honest. Only if he tells the truth of what has 
          taken place, or in other words, only if he reveals his incompetence 
          or failure to achieve the Special Dhamma truthfully, it would amount 
          to accomplishment of the attributes of "<i>uju</i> ". Only when he is 
          candid and honest, will the spiritual teacher be able to put him on 
          the right track. If he sincerely and respectfully meditates as guided 
          by his spiritual teacher, <i>samadhi-nana, </i>penetrating knowledge 
          (by concentration), will soon be developed with progress. If it is done 
          so, treacherous feeling, if any, may be wiped out, and honesty may be 
          revived. In particular, when reaching the stage of <i>udqyabbaya-nana,

          really essential for a Yogi to be docile and obedient. If properly reflected, 
          what others have said with the best of motives is for his own benefit. 
          For instance, a person whose face is stained with soot will be a laughing-stock 
          if he goes to a public function or a ceremony. If another person who 
          has seen him with dirt on his face, has made him known of this fact, 
          he can very well wash and cleanse the dirt on his face. If he goes to 
          the function after cleaning the dirt on his face, he will escape ridicule. 
          If any shortcomings of a person is pointed out by the other, one should 
          be grateful to the well-wisher. Therefore, one should gladly rectify 
          his own fault or mistake if his attention is drawn to it by a friend 
          or a relative. Rahula, when he was seven years old, piled up a mound 
          of sand and even prayed earnestly that he might receive admonition many

          to others who might appear to him as "having no aptitude and initiative". 
          The disaster which came upon the royal family of Sakya Clan brought 
          about by Vidudabha was the consequential effect of negligence and conceit. 
          Hence, one should be gentle in mind without being arrogant and quarrelsome. 
          In this regard the Commentary has pointed out that "one should humiliate 
          himself just as the Venerable Ashin Sariputta has inculcated the habit 
          of humbleness like a mendicant." The mental disposition of the Venerable 
          Ashin Sariputta described in Tuvataka Sutta (on page 38 of the Burmese 
          version) is as stated below:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
          beggar, whether a boy or a girl with an earthenware container in hand 
          and with shabby clothes on, when entering a village, practises humiliation. 
          The Venerable Ashin Sariputta respectfully put up to the Enlightened 
          One that he had submitted himself to humiliation like this beggar boy 
          or girl begging for food. This is really wonderful considering the fact 
          that Ashin Sariputta though born of a high caste<i> </i>Brahmin had 
          condescended to that low level. One should, therefore, emulate his exemplary 
          behaviour. Let us go on the second stanza:</font></p>
<blockquote>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Santussako 
          ca </i>- easily contented, <i>assa - as </i>one should be. To be contented 
          means (1) to be satisfied with what is available; (2) to be satisfied 
          with what can be obtained within one's own ability; (3) to be satisfied 
          with what is suitable or proper. These are the three kinds of "Contentment". 
          If it is multiplied with four kinds of requisites (necessities) for 
          a monk, [3 x 4], it will come to twelve [12]. One should be contented 
          in the light of these twelve qualities of contentment.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
          reference to the mode of contentment mentioned in No. (1) above, a Bhikkhu 
          should content himself with the four kinds of necessary things or properties, 
          viz: meal, robes, monastery or dwelling place, and medicine, as may 
          be available under any circumstances. As regards meal (food), the Lord 
          Buddha had given exhortation to the bikkhus from the time of their first 
          entering into Bikkhuhood as: <i>"Pindiya lopa bhojanam nissaya pabbajja, 
          tattha to yavajivam ussaho karaniyo. "</i>It<i> </i>means, a Bhikkhu 
          should truly maintain his observance of the precepts as a Bhikkhu by 
          merely depending upon the food - may be a spoonful, or a handful - obtained 
          from the respective house of the faithful donor by going in person for 
          alms. The newly ordained Bhikkhu should endeavour to live on this kind 
          of food obtained from the donor throughout his life. The significant 
          point is that he should go round for alms and lead a holy life befitting 
          a Bhikkhu without giving trouble to others, nay, without causing any 
          other person to become burdensome for him.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
          would be a very heavy responsibility on the part of a benefactor if 
          he or she were to cook meals and serve the Bhikkhu everyday. Nobody 
          will have any trouble if the Bhikkhu can obtain food by going round 
          for alms to the houses from where he can receive food and other eatables 
          as may be willingly and generously offered by the benefactors. It is 
          for the Bhikkhus to be contented with whatever is available. It will 
          be <i>dukkata, </i>a breach of <i>sekhiya</i> conduct, of Bhikkhu if 
          he asks for food from a person who is not a relative, without being 
          invited, unless he is sick (<i>a Gilana</i>). It will amount to committing 
          an offence of pacittiya if, for instance, a Bhikkhu receives cash for 
          food or asks for delicious buttered rice, etc. Even at the time of serving 
          the meals, if a Bhikkhu is not invited, he should not ask for it. Nowadays, 
          one can come across some Bhikkhus near a famous shrine, or a crowded 
          place like a wharf or a jetty, asking for cash to be donated to them. 
          These are a few instances where breach of conduct of Bhikkhu is involved. 
          Some might offer cash. Every time a Bhikkhu handles the cash that is 
          offered it will amount to committing Nisaggiya Pacittiya offence of 
          Bhikkhu. Such a faulty conduct is harmful to the Sasana.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          misconduct, according to the Rules of Vinaya, and its degrading effect 
          on the prestige of the noble Sasana are due to discontentment. It will 
          be of advantage to a Bhikkhu if there is contentment. He will be free 
          from fault and this will be in the interests of the Sasana. All good 
          and noble Bhikkhus should be contented with whatever is available for, 
          their daily consumption of food.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          regards robes, Buddha had instructed to be- content with <i>pamsukula 
          </i>robes, i.e. robes made of rags taken from a refuse heap. Permission 
          has been granted to wear. the robes donated by the benefactors of their 
          own accord and out of generosity. As such, a Bhikkhu should remain in 
          contentment with any kind of robes which he may receive in accordance 
          with the Rules of Discipline. If he seeks for any other kind of robes 
          contrary to the Bhikkhu's conduct, he is deemed to have committed an 
          offence.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          respect of lodging and bed, Buddha has instructed the Bhikkhus to stay 
          at the foot or under the shade of a tree, or reside in a monastery or 
          a building offered as a gift. To remain in contentment is essential. 
          If a Bhikkhu accepts cash and requests that a building be constructed 
          with that money, or if he receives the gift of money in person and keeps 
          it in his possession, or if he personally spends this money for the 
          purpose of building a monastery, he is guilty of the Bhikkhu's offence. 
          It is also against the Rule of Discipline for Bhikkhus to dwell in such 
          a building either by him or any other Bhikkhu.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, 
          in so far as medicines or drugs are concerned, Buddha had laid down 
          instructions for Bhikkhus to take urine of cattle as medicine, called 
          <i>putimutta</i>. It is learnt that some people who suffer from neurotic 
          pain have been cured by taking orally the cattle urine. Medicine which 
          has been discarded as rotten and putrid is called. putimutta in a way. 
          This definition calls for consideration whether it is the real intention 
          of the Buddha because according to the present day pharmaceutical plants 
          or pharmacologists they have instructed to avoid taking medicines or 
          drugs the potency of which has expired. If the stinking and putrid drugs 
          are taken, it may not have the desired effect for not being efficacious 
          to remedy the disease. Also, it may be difficult to search for a medicine 
          that has been discarded. Hence, there is food for thought as to whether, 
          according to the interpretation of the grammatical term <i>"putimutta", 
          </i>it will fall in line with what is really intended to mean by the 
          Buddha Himself.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          regard to medicine, a sick Bhikkhu can ask for it from any person. However, 
          it will be a Nissaggiya offence for a Bhikkhu if he asks for a gift 
          of money from others, buys medicine and makes use of it. Contentment 
          is also necessary relating to the medicine that is available. If he 
          remains in contentment with what is available, it is known as <i>"yathalabhasantosa".</i></font>
</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then,

          and medicines which he received in exchange for his own properties which

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          then, consuming food or wearing robes, etc., which are pure in quality 
          and which have been received in exchange for his properties that are 
          considered too good and improper for him to make use of them is called 
          <i>"yathasaruppasantosa'. </i>It means, "to be contented or satisfied 
          with properties appropriate or suitable for the purpose". In brief, 
          one should have entire satisfaction with the said three kinds of contentment, 
          and more broadly speaking, with the twelve kinds of contentment. Otherwise, 
          one can be guilty as stated. In this mundane world, to have satisfaction 
          with one's own lot is important. If no contentment can be found, one 
          can become miserable. Being eagerly desirous of something which is not 
          within his own reach, if one does anything that ought not to be done, 
          he is likely to commit a criminal offence. If he yearns for a thing 
          which is not obtainable, extreme misery will befall him. If the head 
          of a household is not satisfied with the meals cooked and served at 
          his own home, he can be at loggerheads with the housewife, or that he 
          may pick up a quarrel on that score which will thereby cause misery 
          to him. In the present </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">day 
          world, there are a number of multi-millionaires who have become miserable 
          for not being contented with what they own and possess. However, a person 
          who is living from hand to mouth, if satisfied with his lot, can find 
          happiness. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
          is the reason why Buddha has preached as: <i>"Santutthi" </i>- Contentment 
          is, <i>"Paramam dhanam" - </i>the<i> </i>best and the </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">noblest

          fact that meals, robes, etc., offered as gifts by the benefactors may 
          not be good enough to meet one's taste or liking, these should be accepted 
          and made use of without grumble and uttering' with grunt. It is not 
          for a Bhikkhu to pick and choose any kind of gift offered in donation. 
          Otherwise, it will be a burden to the benefactors to support easily. 
          It was stated that at one time during the British regime in Moulmein 
          district, there was a Bhikkhu who refused to take meals without a dish 
          of chicken curry. Hence, his benefactors had to be always worrying about 
          a dish of chicken curry to be provided. And then while travelling, if 
          no chicken dish was available due to circumstances the said Bhikkhu 
          totally abstained from taking meals for the whole day. It is not understood 
          why he had behaved in that odd manner. Whether because he had made a 
          vow emulating the example of a Samanera by the name of <i>Pandita </i>who 
          was desirous of taking his meals only when a dish of "Ngagyin" fish 
          was included in the menu, as mentioned in the Dhammapada Vutthu, no 
          one can say for certain. Such an attitude would amount to <i>dubbhara 
          </i>instead of <i>'Subaru' </i>(frugality). It is for Bhikkhus at this 
          Yeiktha to be satisfied with frugal meals as may be offered by the benefactors.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
          of the narrow-minded Bhikkhus might become surly and make a wry face 
          despite the fact that the offerings. made by the benefactors are of 
          good quality unless these are to their liking. Sometimes, in the presence 
          of the donors, he might give vent to his anger and greed, blaming the 
          donors churlishly and then parted with the offerings by giving them 
          away to others. Such a Bhikkhu is one hard to be pleased and easily 
          supported by the benefactors. A Bhikkhu who is frugal accepts what is 
          offered whether good or bad, with satisfaction and delight which will 
          be reflected on his face. A Bhikkhu who is avaricious and not frugal 
          will find it difficult to develop a feeling of ' metta<i> </i>or loving-kindness. 
          It will also be difficult for him to achieve realisation of knowledge 
          in the practice of other kinds of meditation. That is why Buddha has 
          given instructions to become a frugal person to make it easier for the 
          development and attainment of genuine <i>bhavana, </i>such as, <i>metta

          <i>(parikkhara) </i>are, the three robes, the bowl, the girdle, a needle,

          are readily available and there is no need to be sewn -or stitched by 
          hand personally, and no robes worn by the present day Bhikkhus are in 
          rags. As these are in good condition, it will never come into one's

          needle and thread. All three robes which I took with me were all brand-new. 
          However, at one time, it was found that in one of the robes, a line 
          of stitches, which was originally defective, had gone loose. Then, I 
          had to think of the way how it could be mended. On consultation, being 
          made with one Ashin Ariyavamsa, a Ceylonese Bhikkhu, who was with us, 
          he said he had with him a needle and thread and that he would do the 
          stitching. I had to tell him that it would not be troublesome for me 
          to stitch it up and requested him to lend me his needle and thread for 
          the purpose. In view of this incident, it has occurred to me that it 
          would be advisable to take along a needle and thread when travelling 
          on a long distant journey. Carrying a needle and thread is not at all

          it is <i>"Indriya". </i>In English, it means: "the six doors of senses, 
          viz: the eye, ear, nose, tongue, touch and mind." One can see only if 
          there is an eye. When an object is seen, it can be perceived as much 
          as the eye with its strength of vision can see. Therefore, the eye is 
          governable insofar as the faculty of seeing is concerned. Because it 
          is so governable, the eye is called <i>"Cakkhundriyam </i>The car, etc., 
          in respect of its faculty of hearing, is also governable. That is why 
          the ear, etc., is called <i>"Satindriyam" </i>All these <i>Indriyas 
          </i>should be kept under restraint, with a tranquil mind. If good or 
          pleasant sights and sounds are seen, or heard as the case may be, a 
          person who is attracted to these sensational objects will find them 
          pleasurable and then he will become fidgety. He becomes' restless, smiling 
          and laughing when sensations arise from good smell, fine taste, and 
          pleasurable touch. In the same way, when he sees an ugly sight, hears 
          unpleasant sound, smell bad odour, etc., he becomes perturbed and restless 
          if he is unable to tolerate such bad sensations. He may even murmur

          The best way is to keep control of one's own mind by contemplating and 
          noting at the moment of seeing, hearing, and so on. It will not be easy 
          to do so for those who have no experience in contemplating mindfulness. 
          Therefore, it will be sufficient enough for him to remain indifferent 
          whether the sensations are good or bad. If however, painful sensations 
          become extreme, one should try his utmost to control them through reflection.</font></p>

          reflective knowledge called <i>pariharika. </i>Among these knowledges, 
          the one which knows how to manage things relating to robes, etc., does 
          not seem to be urgently required in the matter of developing metta <i>bhavana. 
          </i>However, an insertion of this particular knowledge has been probably 
          made as it might become essential when practising meditation <i>(bhavana)

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
          is necessary to consider whether it will be proper to reside in a wooden 
          monastery, or a monastery made of bamboo, or masonry, and whether the 
          place is peaceful, tranquil and congenial. In connection with the village 
          where alms can be obtained, it is to be considered whether offerings 
          of food will be received and whether there can be molestation particularly 
          because uncommon or different kinds of sensations may arise. It is to 
          consider as to what kind of talk that is uttered or heard, can be harmful 
          to the practice of meditation. If there is nothing in particular, the 
          best thing would be to abstain from talking anything not relevant to 
          Dhamma. As regards individuals, it is to reflect whether there is any 
          progress or lack of progress relating to Dhamma by relying upon such 
          and such a spiritual teacher or other persons with whom he has to deal. 
          With reference to food, it is to consider what kind of food will be 
          agreeable and beneficial for him to depend upon from the point of view 
          of health and of the Dhamma. One should also reflect as to what kind 
          of posture will be best suited to make progressive strides in the exercise 
          of his meditation. This is the way how mature reflective knowledge should 
          take place or has taken place, whether it will be profitable or not,

          free from rudeness</b></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          next expression is: <i>"appagabbho c</i>a" - free from impudence, <i>assa</i> 
          - as it should be. To be free from impudence conveys the meaning of 
          being impolite or rude. There are three kinds of incivility, viz: (1) 
          rudeness of physical behaviour, (2) rudeness of verbal behaviour, and 
          (3) rudeness of mental behaviour.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(1) 
          Rudeness of physical behaviours manifests itself. under eight situations 
          or conditions. Of these eight, what is generally found at the present 
          time, needs elaboration. Whether in the midst of an audience of sanghas, 
          or amidst the public, to take a sitting posture with knees up, or with 
          the thighs widely extended, is a clear evidence of rude bodily behaviour, 
          or rather, unrefined manners. Sometimes, posture may be taken with either 
          one knee up, or both the knees up with the hands folded across the knees. 
          Such sitting postures also indicate rudeness of physical behaviour. 
          If sitting or standing by touching the body of Maha Theras, or, sitting 
          or standing in front of them, or on an elevated place, or sitting by 
          pulling over the long skirt - "longyi" on the body from head to toe, 
          or, talking to others in a standing posture, or talking or chattering 
          with gesticulation, i.e. expressive motion of the limbs, are clear instances 
          of rudeness of bodily behaviour. If one squeezes himself in a congested 
          place where young Bikkhus are sitting, or if one occupies the seats 
          meant for the Maha Theras, or if one overtakes the Maha Thera while 
          walking, etc., is obviously rude and uncultured. One should avoid, all 
          such impolite physical behaviours and mannerisms.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          the present day, it is learnt that some elderly Bhikkhus under the guise 
          of noble personages even make a pretentious display of supernatural 
          powers by caressing or making a fondling touch on the head of the damsels 
          with their hands as if they are blessing them. Such indecent behaviours 
          are totally prohibited under the Rules of Vinaya. It has been strictly 
          laid down, under the said Rules that the Bhikkhus should not - even 
          give a fondling touch to their own daughters and mothers. A condition 
          has been prescribed Prohibiting Bhikkhus from handling even a doll representing 
          a female figure with pleasurable sensation. Hence, a fondling touch 
          made as stated in the foregoing, may be said to be a rude bodily demeanour.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
          thing is that while sanghas are taking meals, or when taking meals together 
          with others, emitting nasal secretion, or ejecting phlegm by coughing, 
          or spitting are regarded as unrefined manners inasmuch as these are 
          despicable. Such disgusting behaviours should also be avoided.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(2) 
          Relating to rudeness of verbal behaviour, there are four conditions. 
          In the midst of an assembly of Sanghas or of people, or in the presence 
          of Maha Theras, if there is anything to be said, one should speak only 
          after permission has been sought from Maha Theras. Any utterance made 
          without permission, is rudeness of verbal behaviour. If an explanation 
          is given relating to a problematic issue without seeking permission, 
          it would also amount to verbal misbehaviour. It is discourteous, or 
          rather, rudeness of verbal behaviour if resorted to making utterances 
          in the midst of an audience of Sanghas, or in the presence of Maha Theras, 
          and also asking the benefactors as to whether there is something to 
          eat, or whether there is any meal or food, etc., ready to be offered 
          to him while visiting the homes of the benefactors. Bhikkhus should 
          refrain themselves from behaving in the like manner, which, in fact, 
          is in contravention of the Rules of Conduct for Bhikkhus.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(3) 
          Rudeness of mental behaviour means: to be disrespectful by thoughts 
          to those who deserve respect. To think of a person superior in caste 
          or racial status as being his equal, or imagine a noble personage endowed 
          with <i>sila, samadhi and panna,</i> as being his equal, or if a person 
          who is lacking in knowledge or rather, unlearned in scriptures imagines 
          an intellectual person as his equal, or if a person imagines the other 
          as being unintellectual, nay, unknowledgeable as compared to him, or 
          if a person who does not meditate imagines a well-accomplished meditator 
          as his equal, are instances of rudeness of mental behaviour. Therefore, 
          one should totally be free from all physical, verbal and mental misbehaviours.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>14. To be freed 
          of attachment to both male and female benefactors</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	The next word. 
          is <i>"Kulesu" - </i>among relatives - (The meaning of <i>'kula' 
          is </i>given as 'relative' as translated ordinarily in Burmese). However, 
          the word 'relative' (<i>kula</i>), in fact, does not convey the sense 
          of 'kinsman' (relative) or a race. What it really means is a 'household' 
          or a family. Hence, in this regard, it seems as if the word <i>"kulesu 
          " is </i>to be interpreted as members of a household family. Nevertheless, 
          this interpretation itself does not really make sense if considered 
          in relation to Bhikkhus. As such, it would be more clear and convincing 
          to translate the word <i>"kulesu " as: </i>male and female benefactors 
          in a household family. <i>Kulesu - as </i>regards male and female benefactors 
          belonging to a family, <i>ananughiddho ca </i>- desirable attachment 
          is also got rid of, <i>assa - </i>as<i> </i>it should be.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually 
          it means that there should be no attachment to male and female benefactors. 
          When a Bhikkhu is going round for alms to receive offerings of food 
          or other things from his male and female benefactors, he should make 
          an approach assuming himself in the role of a noble person worthy of 
          offerings, called "<i>dakkineyya". </i>The benefactors should also donate 
          bearing in mind that the receiver is a noble personage worthy of offerings 
          in order to gain as well as to promote better advantages. Familiarity 
          should be avoided by the Bhikkhu regarding a benefactor as his own kim 
          and kin, or as a close acquaintance. If close intimacy is created by 
          a Bhikkhu, it amounts to taking possession of, or rather, accepting 
          or seizing the offerings with desirable attachment like an eclipse of 
          a planet <i>(gaha). </i>It would be something like attachment to himself. 
          In that case, one is likely to become either rejoiced or sorry. This 
          means, if the benefactors become prosperous and wealthy, the Bhikkhu 
          will also feel happy. Similarly, if the benefactors meet with trouble 
          or any kind of disaster, the Bhikkhu will also become sorry or dejected. 
          This is not the way a noble Bhikkhu should feel or behave. Of course, 
          the benefactors may feel glad if their teacher, the Bhikkhu, shares 
          their feeling of joy and sorrow. However, this is not what the Lord 
          Buddha wishes to happen. Buddha's wish is to see the Bhikkhus fully 
          accomplished with <i>sila, </i>etc., and to preach the Dhamma to his 
          benefactors to gain the noble virtue of <i>kusala.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence, it is for 
          the benefactors to consider their spiritual teacher and guide as a plot 
          of land which is to be cultivated for the germination of the seeds of 
          <i>kusala </i>and to make offerings to him and revere him. For the purpose 
          of cultivating a land, it is really important that this plot of land 
          should be fertile. In the same way, it is essential for a Bhikkhu who 
          is receiving the offerings to have good fertilisers, such as <i>Sila, 
          </i>etc. No financial benefit can be derived by him in the shape of 
          a considerable sum of money by being sorry or dejected or in other words, 
          it does not pay him to lament. If he renders assistance, the most he 
          may probably benefit is by way of receiving gifts to the value of only 
          a hundred or a thousand kyats. A Bhikkhu who is a noble <i>Dakkhineyya 
          </i>with purity of <i>Sila </i>for not having attachment to his benefactors, 
          should not expect any thing. On the part of the benefactors for having 
          generously donated to such a noble Bhikkhu accomplished with the admirable 
          attributes of a holy personage, he is sure to derive <i>kusala - </i>merits<i>
</i>- worth millions if considered in terms of money. A person by the 
          name of Eindaka by virtue of <i>kusala </i>offered a spoonful of food 
          to the Venerable Ashin Anuruddha was reborn as a very powerful <i>Deva 
          </i>in the heavenly abode of <i>Tavatimsa. </i>Considering this fact, 
          it is quite obvious that it is really noble and magnanimous to donate 
          with a virtuous bent of mind on the golden attributes of <i>Sila, </i>etc., 
          of the recipient Bhikkhu. On the contrary, if the benefactors revere 
          and make offerings of gifts to a Bhikkhu treating him as a close<i>
</i>associate expecting temporal advantages, such as, wealth and prosperity, 
          it would amount to grasping or seizing pleasure <i>(gaha). </i>It is 
          something like taking hold of or, influencing the Bhikkhu as a personal 
          secretary. The Commentary has said that if there is dishonest relationship 
          between both the Bhikkhu and the benefactors, it would tantamount to 
          <i>gahagaha. </i>Both the teacher and the benefactor are then considered 
          to be making a seizure, i.e. the one seizes the other, while the other 
          also seizes in retaliation.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
          the benefactors are dishonest despite the fact that a Bhikkhu is dealing 
          with the benefactors in the capacity of a <i>Dakkineyya, </i>it would 
          amount to <i>muttagaha. </i>This<i> </i>means that the benefactors make 
          a seizure but the Bhikkhu has escaped on his part. The effect would 
          be quite the reverse if the Bhikkhu were dishonest. This sort of thing 
          is fairly rampant. If both parties are dealing with one another honestly, 
          it is <i>"Mutta-mutta". </i>Then, both are said to have escaped, or 
          rather, been released from eclipse. Such kind of dealing or relationship 
          is indeed very essential. Explanation given relating to the second verse 
          <i>(gatha) </i>appears sufficiently comprehensive. We shall go on teaching 
          the third <i>gatha </i>(stanza):</font></p>

          this regard, the word <i>"sukhino" </i>should be interpreted in a grammatical 
          sense. Hence, it is to develop <i>metta </i>either mentally or verbally 
          by reciting as: "May all beings be happy and free from danger." In the 
          expression <i>"sukhitatta", </i>the word <i>"sukhita" </i>means: "to 
          have happiness", according to the rule of grammar. "<i>Atta" </i>conveys 
          the meaning of either "mind" or "body". If it is said to be "body", 
          it can be taken to mean both material <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama. </i>Grammatically, 
          it means: "To have both body and mind accomplished with happiness." 
          It would therefore mean: "being happy both physically and mentally". 
          As such, according to the said ' expression, <i>metta </i>can be developed

          and then dissolves. The thought<b> </b>which is to be borne in mind

          The physical behaviour and the voice which utters also occur afresh 
          again and again. This <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>that dissolve repeatedly 
          and immediately after occurrence, should be contemplated every time 
          recitation is made and at every moment thought arises. This manner of 
          contemplation is Vipassana <i>Khayato vayato sammasitva, </i>i.e. it 
          can be achieved up to the stage of <i>Arahatta-phala </i>after observing

          - Trembling and shaking with fear may be caused by anger or human passions, 
          lust and desirable attachment <i>(tanha). </i>Those who are prone to 
          fright are living beings who are not yet free from anger or hatred, 
          such as, ordinary worldlings, Sotapannas, and Sakadagamis. Those beings 
          who get frightfully affected by passionate desires are common worldlings

          Sakadagamis dan Anagamis. How they are seized with fear because of passionate 
          desires <i>(tanha) is </i>something similar to beings who are anxious 
          for not getting or receiving which they crave for, of wish to obtain. 
          Those whose mind is tranquil, unperturbed and steadfast without a feeling 
          of fright are the noble Arahats who are absolutely free from <i>tanha, 
          </i>human passions. Therefore, tasa - those beings who are prone to 
          fear are beings who are not as yet liberated from passionate and desirable 
          attachment. <i>Thavara </i>- beings who have absolutely no fear and 
          are not apprehensive, with serenity and stability of mind, are the Noble 
          Ones - Arahats. Hence, with those two phrases: <i>"Tasa va thavara va</i>", 
          it has been distinguished into two parts or categories, viz: individuals 
          who are not free from <i>tanha, </i>and who have entirely got rid of 
          <i>tanha. </i>These two should be kept distinct and separated in developing 
          <i>metta </i>by reciting according to the said two verses. It should 
          be also combined together with Vipassana in practising contemplation.

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
          this portion of <i>gatha </i>or verse (words), the Buddha prescribed 
          three methods by which <i>Metta </i>should be developed after distinguishing 
          the beings in three different kinds. The first method shown has reference 
          to different kinds of beings according to the size of their body dimension 
          or stature, whether it is long, short, or medium-sized. Out of these 
          three kinds, those beings or creatures who have lengthy bodies are snakes, 
          dragons, lizards, earthworms, etc. Creatures who have short bodies are 
          chickens, birds, frogs, etc. Medium-sized creatures or beings are horses, 
          cattle, buffaloes, pigs, etc. However, it is pretty hard to give a definite 
          decision on the matter of making a specific classification. Let's develop 
          <i>Metta </i>towards these three different kinds of beings or creatures. 
          Please follow the recitation: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May those beings 
            who have long bodies be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May those 
            beings who are dwarf and have short bodies be happy.<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May those 
            beings whose bodies are neither long nor short, i.e. medium-sized 
            be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            those beings who have long, or short, or medium-sized stature be happy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">N.B.	Each and 
            every message of goodwill such as "be happy", may be said three times.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
          the second method explains the way how to develop <i>Metta </i>by distinguishing 
          the beings according to their bodily size as to whether they are big, 
          or small, or medium-sized. Of these three kinds, beings who have huge 
          bodies are marine mammals, such as, big fishes, turtles, etc., and those 
          animal beings living on land, such as, elephant, dragons, etc. They 
          include giants or ogres and also Devas as well as Brahmas of immense 
          bodily dimension from the world of Devas. <i>Anuka </i>- Small and tiny 
          creatures or beings are small invertebrate animals like insects, etc. 
          Human beings, dogs, pigs, fowls, birds, etc., may be regarded as belonging 
          to the category of medium-sized beings. It would also be difficult to 
          give a definite decision as to what kind of beings should be included 
          in the three respective categories as may be appropriate. Let us develop 
          <i>Metta </i>by distinguishing the beings according to the said three 
          kinds. Please join the recitation.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all beings 
            who have huge bodies be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            beings who have small and tiny bodies be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            medium-sized beings who are neither large nor small in their bodies 
            be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            beings who have big, or small, or medium sized bodies or physical 
            structure be happy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">N.B. The word 
            "be happy" is repeated three times.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Next, the third 
          method indicates as to how <i>Metta </i>should be developed distinguishing 
          towards the three </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">different 
          kinds of beings, viz: round, big and fat. beings, tiny creatures and 
          medium-sized beings. Of these three </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">kinds, 
          the big, round and fat beings are fishes, tortoises, molluscs (oysters), 
          snails, etc., whose body structures are </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">short-winded, 
          plump and flabby. <i>Anuka </i>- tiny and diminutive creatures are those 
          which cannot be seen by the naked </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">eye, 
          such as very small insects, germs and fleas. The middle sized beings 
          are those creatures which are ordinarily visible and which may be said 
          to be beings not too big or too bulky or fat. These three kinds of beings 
          are pretty difficult to be classified with certainty under which category 
          they would fall. Hence, the Commentary has stated that in a way, among 
          the same kind of beings, those which are big and not too fat and bulky, 
          as well as medium-sized and tiny creatures or beings, may be said to 
          come under the definition of <i>"Anuka". </i>According to this statement 
          of explanation, it may be considered feasible to include persons with 
          a height of more than five and a half feet, or six feet, weighing over 
          100 Ibs in the category of those who are fat, and to regard persons 
          who are two or three feet in height with less than 100 Ibs. in weight, 
          as short and small beings, and to consider the rest of the people as 
          medium-sized beings. This is also difficult to decide. As such, it' 
          would appear proper to develop <i>Metta </i>by merely noting ordinarily 
          as big and fat, small and medium sized, without precisely distinguishing 
          the beings. Let us therefore develop <i>Metta </i>according to the last-mentioned 
          three different kinds. We may recite as follows: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all beings 
            whose physical structure is round and fat be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            beings whose physical structure is very, tiny and small be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            beings who have medium-sized physical structure be happy."<br/>
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            fat, tiny, and middle-sized beings be happy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">N.B. The word 
            "be happy" may be repeated three times.</font></p>

          by "beings", are the Arahats who will not be reborn in another existence 
          for their having ceased to become. "Beings" who are about to become 
          are those ordinary worldlings <i>(Puthujjana) </i>and Sekkha individuals 
          who will be reborn again in the next existence as they have not been 
          free from <i>kilesas, </i>human passions or moral defilement. According 
          to the grammatical sense, it refers to beings who are seeking (Esi) 
          for another rebirth, or rather, fresh existence to become again <i>(sambhava). 
          </i>Those beings who are seeking for new existence are those who will 
          have a continuum of life existence. They are still about to become. 
          Hence, to be more appropriate in the usage of the conjunctive word, 
          and to be closely coherent, the expression: "Beings about to become" 
          has been used. Therefore, let us develop according to this definition.

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Putting it in another 
          way, it means a person who has entered into the womb of an earthly mother, 
          i.e. at the time of conception <i>(sambhavesi), </i>seeking for a new 
          existence. After being born, he is deemed to be a person who has </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">become

          Paro - </i>one<i> </i>other person, <i>param - </i>against<i> </i>another,

          nay, may escape from becoming a victim of fraud. In commercial or business 
          affairs, fraudulent dealings or deception may take place. In religious 
          affairs, deception is also practised. In the matter of making a business 
          deal, criminal deception done is by way of deceiving the buyer by the 
          seller in his transaction by the use of a false weight less than the 
          correct weight by placing it on scales or weighing-machine, or, by using 
          a measuring cup or vessel which holds less in quantity of goods or commodities 
          in. relation to a standard container, vessel or receptacle. This kind 
          of trick being fairly common is well-known to the majority of the people. 
          Another thing is found in the sale of articles made of gold or silver, 
          and gold or silver ingots, which are imitations or spurious, i.e. not 
          genuine. This is also not uncommon. Sometimes, a cheat may pose himself 
          as an honest man. At one time during the anniversary of a<i> puja</i> 
          celebration held in this Meditation centre, it so happened that a cheat 
          visited a group of Shan people and played a deception on them. It was 
          disclosed that after the cheat had seen bundles of currency notes in 
          the hands of those Shan people, he persuaded them that if those currency 
          notes were exchanged, they would get more money. Believing his words, 
          some of them who were rather greedy, entrusted the cheat with their 
          currency notes. The cheat, after promising them that he would bring 
          back more money than what was originally worth, took away the money. 
          </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
          deceived others into believing that they would turn the original weight 
          of gold into a greater amount. Credulous persons with greed wishing 
          to receive more gold, handed over the gold in trust to the cheat. Not 
          long afterwards, this cheat had disappeared never to return to them 
          again. This is another kind of deceit. Then also, some offered charms 
          or rather, magic trinkets to be worn so as to supposedly bring good 
          luck and fortune to the one who wears it. Such kinds of deception should 
          make one reflect as to whether it is believable or not. There are quite 
          a variety of deceptive practices in connection with business dealings. 
          </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          matters relating to religion, deceptive practices are in plenty. To 
          preach false doctrines ostensibly as truth, would cause to bring disadvantages 
          to others who have accepted such heresy. During the lifetime of Lord 
          Buddha, an ascetic called Punna who was practising austerities like 
          an ox and another by the name of Seniya who was practising like a dog, 
          called on the Buddha and asked what advantages could be derived from 
          indulgences of such practices. The Enlightened One prevented them twice 
          from putting up this problematic question. On being asked for the third 
          time, the Buddha gave the answer as below:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"A 
          person who indulges in the practice like an ox or rather a bullock to 
          the full, will become an ox after his demise. So also, a person who 
          has fully practised like a dog, will be reborn a dog in the next existence. 
          If the practices performed are incomplete and not fully accomplished, 
          it would amount to practising deception under a false pretence, and 
          the person who thus practises for having accepted the heretical views, 
          would either descend to the Nether World (hell) or become an animal 
          after his death."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having 
          heard the Buddha's reply, Punna and Seniya wept bitterly. They wept 
          because after becoming victims of fraud, they had gone through such 
          ignoble and false practices for a considerable length of time, believing 
          their teacher's deceitful words that by practising either as an ox or 
          a dog, they would reach an existence in life hereafter where happy conditions 
          prevail.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Another 
          instance is that one Talaputa, an instructor by profession in the art 
          of dancing, reverentially asked the Buddha, "My Lord! I have heard what 
          other teachers in succession have said that a dancer being capable of 
          giving delight and pleasure to the public, will, in his next existence, 
          become a jovial or clownish Deva called <i>"pahasa" </i>in another planet. 
          What then is your Lordship's Teaching in regard to this matter?" Buddha 
          twice rejected this question; but when the same question was raised 
          for the third time, the Enlightened One gave a categorical reply as: 
          "From the very outset, the dancer for having entertained with his performances 
          to the delight of the audience who are as yet unliberated from the evils 
          of greed <i>(loba), </i>anger (<i>dosa</i>) and delusion <i>(moha) </i>has 
          caused to develop the ills of greed, anger and delusion. Hence, in the 
          next existence after his demise, it is very likely that he would relegate 
          to hell, called <i>"pahasa" </i>By firmly holding a false and bigoted 
          view that if by performing the dances, he would become a Deva in his 
          future existence, he will probably land either in hell or become an 
          animal."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hearing 
          this statement, Talaputa, the chief Dance Instructor began to cry because 
          he had been deceived by his teachers all throughout a long period of 
          time that "by staging dancing performances before an ' audience to make 
          them happy and pleasurable, one will become a <i>'pahasa' Deva "</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Moreover, 
          there are similar instances of this kind of deception. At the present 
          time, a number of preachings are being done, which run counter to the 
          noble wish of the Enlightened One, on an erroneous assumption of the 
          Buddha's Dhamma. Although Buddha has precisely preached without any 
          ambiguity that "all <i>akusala </i>- demeritorious acts - should be 
          avoided, all kusala - virtuous deeds should be performed, practical 
          exercise should be made for the achievement of <i>sila</i>, <i>samadhi 
          </i>and <i>panna. </i>Samatha and Vipassana meditation should invariably 
          be practised, the Eight-fold <i>maggangas </i>should be developed", 
          preaching contrary to the Buddha's Noble Teachings are being delivered. 
          Such false preachings made are in the manner described below.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>'Akusala-kilesa 
          </i>means impermanence <i>(anicca). </i>As<i> </i>such, for not being 
          permanently present, no rejection is required to be done. To make effort 
          for the purpose of killing is more difficult than to refrain from killing 
          others. It is suffering according to the <i>desana </i>which says <i>sabbe 
          sankhara dukkha </i>if meritorious deeds are performed or if sila, <i>samadhi 
          </i>and <i>panna </i>practices are exercised; and if bhavana, practical 
          meditation is resorted to. Preachings are also done that it would amount, 
          to practising asceticism and that all forms of severe exercises causing 
          physical hardship are miserable. They go on preaching further that simply 
          by retiring or remaining in seclusion at peace without putting in any 
          effort in the practice of meditation, happiness is gained, etc." Such 
          kind of nonsensical talks are obviously contrary to the Buddha's Teachings. 
          Such being the case, it is quite certain that those who have accepted 
          this wrong faith with a false belief in those perversities which are 
          diametrically opposite to the Noble Teachings of the Buddha, will have 
          been developing <i>akusala - </i>unwholesome<i> </i>acts - without gaining 
          merits. Eventually, without anything to be relied upon, these people. 
          are likely to become unhappy through their own personal experience when 
          confronted with misery and suffering, at one time or the other, since 
          evil <i>kamma </i>or <i>akusala will </i>predominate over <i>kusala 
          </i>which has ceased to function, for being subjected to fraud.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As stated in the 
          foregoing, a person who has been deceived will suffer badly either from 
          the point of view of </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">his 
          business deal or of religion. It will however be more disastrous if 
          he is defrauded in religious matters. Therefore, </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddha 
          has instructed to develop <i>metta </i>as: "May be free from deception" 
          either in dealing with business or religious </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">affairs. 
          Let us recite according to that instruction.</font></p>

            from becoming a victim of fraud." </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(Repeat

          next phrase is: <i>"katthaci" - </i>at<i> </i>any place or anywhere

          any one person, <i>nam - </i>as against another person, <i>na atimannetha 
          - may </i>not disregard or slight, nay, may be free from becoming discourteous 
          to or ignoring the other. If the other person is slighted or ignored 
          by one with egoism, it would be sinful to the person who slights or 
          ignores. This kind of attitude will have an adverse effect on him at 
          one time or the other. A person who is slighted will feel bad and very 
          much depressed. , Some of the senior officers may ignore or slight an 
          outsider or even a junior ' officer if that person calls on him on duty. 
          Some of the Maha Theras are likely to neglect or ignore the junior monks. 
          Those who are thus slighted or neglected may feel extremely unhappy. 
          There is hardly any doubt that the person who slights the other has 
          no loving-kindness towards the other for having failed to put himself 
          in another's shoes. That is probably the reason why Buddha has given 
          instructions to develop <i>metta </i>whereby the occurrence of miserable 
          feelings in both parties will be prevented. If cordial relationship 
          were established. between the two parties without slighting one another, 
          the whole world would be a very congenial place for everybody to live 
          in. Please follow the recitation in developing <i>metta </i>according 
          to the given instructions.</font></p>

          become unfavourable, he will meet with various kinds of suffering for 
          that <i>akusala, </i>bad deeds, he has committed. The person who is 
          subjected to ill-treatment, of course, presently suffers. It has, therefore, 
          been instructed to develop <i>metta </i>towards others to be free from 
          such miseries by avoidance of the said misdeeds. To develop <i>metta

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          this verse, the manner of relationship between mother and son has been 
          particularly cited as an example. Generally, mother's affection and 
          loving-care for sons and daughters far surpasses that of the father. 
          That is the reason why the mother has been cited as an example. Loving-care 
          and affection may not be bestowed upon adopted children by the parents 
          as such as they would confer on their own children. Hence, an example 
          of "the only beloved son" is cited. However, if there are many sons, 
          the degree or strength of affectionate feeling and loving-care may not 
          be great despite the fact that they are their own flesh and blood. Usually, 
          boundless love is bestowed upon the only son in a family. That is why 
          comparison has been made to "the only son". The degree of love for the 
          only son is well known to mothers who have sons of their own. This needs 
          no elaboration. The mother will sacrifice her own life for her only 
          son, the only child of her own, when occasion demands. Similarly, in 
          developing <i>metta, </i>it has been instructed that one should have 
          utmost loving-kindness and compassionate feeling towards all beings 
          regardless of oneself. The example that has been illustrated is really 
          deep and profound.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I 
          have mentioned about how <i>"simasambheda" </i>takes place as explained 
          in the Visuddhimagga in the second part of this text of Dhamma. In this 
          connection what has been stated is that while a person who is developing 
          <i>metta </i>is living together with the person who is dear to him and 
          person who is neutral, and also an enemy - a hostile person, he should 
          not accede to the wish of the villains who demanded any one of them 
          to be handed over to them for the purpose of offering him as a gift 
          to propitiate a god in performing a. ritual. Even if he 'surrendered 
          himself as a victim, it will not yet amount to achievement of the quality 
          of <i>samasambheda. </i>On the other hand, according to the Metta Sutta; 
          it would convey the sense that one who is developing <i>Metta </i>should 
          radiate his loving-kindness, wishing the other to gain happiness just 
          as a mother would do with immense love for her only son which soars 
          to the extent of her willingness to sacrifice her own life. If reference 
          were made to what is stated in the Commentary comparing with the Pali 
          Text, it will be found that the illustration is made<b> </b>with emphasis 
          upon the deep feeling of <i>metta </i>which one should have towards 
          beings just as a mother is lovingly taking care of her own son. It should 
          be interpreted to mean that one must have a feeling of loving-kindness 
          towards other beings to the extent as he would have for his own welfare. 
          The instruction given in many Pali Texts indicate one to develop <i>metta 
          </i>towards all other beings on an equal basis as he would have on himself 
          <i>(sabbathataya). </i>There are no instructions to the effect that 
          one should have love for others more than one would love oneself.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Furthermore, 
          <i>metta bhavana </i>means: one should not leave out any one of the 
          living beings, that is, without exception and without limit in developing 
          <i>metta </i>through. meditation, if capable of doing so.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          also be rejected with his background knowledge of what has been heard 
          and noticed <i>(sutamayanana) </i>long before meditation is practised. 
          If he is a person who has achieved <i>metta-jhana, </i>he should first 
          of all absorbed himself in that <i>jhana, </i>and on being awakened 
          from the trance of <i>jhana, </i>rejection should be done through his 
          realisation of the said <i>jhana </i>and <i>rupa, </i>the material body, 
          on which reliance is made, by practising contemplation. As regards a 
          person who has not yet achieved <i>jhana, </i>he should reject through 
          his intuitive knowledge by contemplating with mindfulness on <i>rupa 
          </i>which is relied upon, and through recitation which is the object 
          of Sense, at every moment of developing <i>Metta </i>as "May be happy", 
          or, "May all beings be happy". It should also be rejected by relying 
          fundamentally on <i>metta-jhana, </i>and by realising the truth through 
          contemplation of the respective phenomenon of <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas.</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No 
          special mention need be made with regard to the manner of rejection 
          by <i>sutamaya </i>knowledge. The phenomenal nature of <i>rupa </i>and 
          <i>nama </i>be rejected by practical exercise, noting and reflecting 
          after listening to the sermon as far as possible.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          manner of rejection by contemplation and awareness of the <i>jhana </i>after 
          plunging in <i>jhana, </i>is<i> </i>to contemplate on the Jhanic-mind 
          when consciousness in <i>jhana </i>has ceased. after his absorption 
          in <i>metta-jhana. </i>It is just like those persons with no achievement 
          of <i>jhana </i>who realise by contemplating and noting the mind that 
          imagines and knows at every moment of arising consciousness. It is required 
          to contemplate and become aware several times repeatedly by absorbing 
          in <i>jhana </i>and by contemplating the Jhanic-mind. It will<i> </i>then 
          become obvious in the course of contemplation that consciousness of 
          the Jhanic-mind wishing others happy, and <i>rupa </i>on which reliance 
          is made as well as the Vipassana mind which contemplates and knows, 
          are quite different from one another. At that moment, the material object 
          of <i>rupa </i>that is depended upon and which does not know and feel 
          the sensation, will be found quite distinct from the consciousness of 
          the Jhanic-mind that has just occurred wishing others happy, and also 
          the mind that contemplates and knows, will be visualised and distinguishably 
          realised. It will then be distinguishably known with one's own insight 
          knowledge that there is no 'living entity', no 'being' and no 'atta-being', 
          and that this material body is comprised of two different things viz: 
          the one which knows the sensation and the other which does not know 
          the sensation. When realised as such, <i>attaditthi, which </i>holds 
          the view of atta as 'a -being', will be got rid of. This is the manner 
          by which ditch - the false view, is completely dispelled or exterminated 
          with the knowledge of <i>nama-rupa pariccheda, </i>i.e., knowledge of 
          discernment distinguishing between mind and matter, after practising 
          <i>metta-jhana </i>and <i>Vipassana</i> by turns.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">From 
          this stage, if effort is continuously made in his meditational exercise

          <i>jhana, </i>realisation' will come through personal insight knowledge 
          that there is only Cause and Effect. This knowledge will lead to rejection 
          of that <i>Dittha. </i>Thereafter, <i>jhana </i>as well as the contemplative 
          mind with awareness, and the <i>rupa </i>on which reliance is made, 
          will be found continually arising and dissolving. Rejection will then 
          be made knowing the characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and <i>anatta.

          present Yogis (meditators) here are initially contemplating on the rising 
          and falling movements of the abdomen which is regarded as fundamental. 
          In the course of contemplating and noting as described, the imagination 
          and thoughts that may occur should again be contemplated and noted. 
          Thereafter, contemplating and noting be reverted to the rising and falling 
          of the abdominal movements. If bodily sensations of pain, stiffness 
          and hotness are felt, then these sensations should be contemplated and 
          noted, as and when they occur. Afterwards, it should be reverted back 
          to contemplation and noting of the rising and falling movements of the 
          abdomen tending and stretching of hands and feet, if taken place, should 
          likewise be noted. While contemplation is done in the like manner, the 
          sense-object of contemplation and noting, and the knowing-mind will 
          be distinguishably known. Cause and Effect are also distinctly realised. 
          The nature of their impermanence <i>(anicca), </i>suffering <i>(dukkha) 
          </i>and non-Self <i>(anatta) </i>will be apprehended with the personal 
          knowledge in the process of contemplating and noting the psycho-physical 
          phenomena. When <i>bhanga-nana </i>(Insight knowledge into the dissolution 
          of things) gets strengthened with constant awareness as stated, contemplating 
          and noting should be spread widely beginning from every sensation of 
          touch and contact covering the whole body. If tiresomeness occurs while 
          so meditating and if contemplating and noting loses its momentum, the 
          mind that contemplates and notes be reverted to the usual rising and 
          falling of the abdominal wall. Only when the body and mind becomes tranquil, 
          further contemplation of all bodily phenomena should be carried on and 
          noted.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
          contemplation gains strength in the manner as stated, achievement of 
          progressive insight will be advanced towards <i>baya-nana, adhinava-nana, 
          nibbida-nana, muncitukamyata-nana </i>and <i>patisankha-nana </i>and 
          thereafter, the stage <i>of sankharupekkha-nana </i>will<i> </i>be reached. 
          At that stage, all objects of contemplation, will be perceived automatically 
          without making exertion. Vipassana, with its penetrating insight will 
          also occur spontaneously. Then, one will be unable to pursue and note 
          with his knowledge the arising of a number <i>of </i>sensations occurring 
          over the whole body, and only automatic awareness of a few usual sensations 
          is taking place. It is also very delicate and gentle. And awareness 
          is also very, very clear. There are times when continuous<b> </b>contemplation 
          is to be carried on one after the other on roughly about three phenomena, 
          such as, the nature of<i> </i>the rising of the abdomen, falling of 
          the abdomen, and stiffness felt in the sitting posture, the entire body 
          being thought of as having vanished altogether. Sometimes, the meditator 
          may become aware of only the two occurrences, viz: "rising" and "falling" 
          of the abdomen, oblivious of the fact that he is sitting. Occasionally, 
          moments may arise when consciousness fails to grasp the "rising and 
          falling" of the abdomen, and if it so happens, he may be fixing his 
          attention only on the clear knowing mind merely contemplating and noting 
          it as "knowing", "knowing". While being conscious of what is happening, 
          awareness becomes greatly accelerated, and sudden cessation of the contemplating 
          object and mind will be perceived and realised. The knowledge and perception 
          of the cessation of all <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas is "magga-nana"</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          a matter of fact, rejection of <i>attaditthi </i>called <i>arammananussaya

          the faculty of Vipassana insight knowledge which has become aware of 
          the existence of only ru<i>pa </i>and <i>nama, </i>in the course of

          <i>gedham </i>clinging pleasurable attachment called <i>kamatanha, vinaya 
          </i>having been rejected by the knowledge of <i>anagamimagga, </i>or 
          rather, when rejected, so - such a person after becoming a Sotapanna, 
          will reach the stage of <i>sakadagami-magga-phala </i>if continuous 
          contemplation is practised. Again, when further contemplation is carried 
          on after becoming a Sakadagami, he will attain <i>anagamimagga, </i>which 
          will totally eradicate <i>kamatanha. </i>He will then proceed to achieve 
          <i>anagami-phala </i>to become an Anagami. An Anagami person, after 
          his death, will be reborn in Suddhavasa Abode of the Brahma World. He 
          becomes an inhabitant of Aviha Abode, the last of the five Suddhavasas. 
          There are some who enter Parinibbana after achieving Arahatship. If 
          he does not as yet become an Arahat in that abode. he will reach an 
          abode called, Atappa after expiry of the life-span of one thousand <i>kappas. 
          </i>There are some who, after attainment of Arahatship while living 
          in that abode of <i>Atappa, </i>enter into Parinibbana. If Arahatship 
          is not yet attained in that abode, after two thousand <i>kappas </i>of 
          his life-span, he will be reborn in the abode of <i>Sudassa </i>There 
          are instances where some who die at the end of their life span there 
          after becoming Arahats. Again, if he still fails to attain Arahatship 
          in that abode, he will meet with his death after four thousand <i>kappas, 
          </i>and reach the abode of <i>Sudassa </i>There too, some might pass 
          away, i.e. enter into Parinibbana after attaining Arahatship. Similar 
          course of events will be gone through up to <i>akanittha, </i>the highest 
          abode of Suddhavasa, where the life period runs very. long to the extent 
          of sixteen thousand <i>kappas. </i>During this extraordinary length 
          of lifetime, one will definitely become an Arahat and then finally enter 
          into Parinibbana. Parinibbana means the Ultimate and complete cessation 
          of all <i>rupa-nama-khandhas </i>on the demise of an Arahat. This is 
          the last of his round of existences in <i>samsara. </i>All human passions 
          and desirable attachment which bind mankind to existence and all that 
          lead to rebirth, will be wholly extinct. This is the end of all miseries, 
          a Blissful State, the lamp of life having been burnt out. On death, 
          he will forever be released from becoming, thereby misery and suffering 
          of old age, sickness and death, which are the concomitant effects of 
          the life existence, will be escaped. It is the - absolute extinction 
          of a being whereby eternal bliss is gained.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          reaching the abodes of <i>Suddhavasa </i>as stated, he comes to a road-end 
          culminating in death known as Parinibbana. Human existence is no more 
          for him and there is no likelihood of his entering into a mother's womb. 
          This has been elucidated in the following manner:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So 
          - That a person who has achieved <i>metta-jhana, "ditthinca anupagamma" 
          </i>- being undesirous of clinging to this <i>attaditthi, </i>nay, since 
          <i>attaditthi </i>has been expelled by Vipassana knowledge, <i>"silava" 
          - </i>is not only accomplished with the insight-knowledge of Vipassana. 
          As such, <i>"kamesu" </i>- the sensations of sensual pleasures, <i>"gedham" 
          - to </i>which the desires of <i>kamatanha, </i>human passions, are 
          clinging, <i>"vinaya"" </i>- being rejected with <i>anagami-magga-nana, 
          </i>nay, having been already rejected, <i>"gabbhaseyyam" - </i>formation 
          of new existence which requires conception in a mother's womb, <i>"puna" 
          - </i>again,<i> "na hi jati eti" - </i>will<i> </i>not definitely take 
          place, or in other words, he will enter into Parinibbana without again 
          conceiving in a mother's womb.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          gist of it is that <i>jhana </i>will<i> </i>be achieved by developing 
          <i>Metta </i>through meditation. If Vipassana contemplation is made 
          based upon this <i>jhana, </i>one will reach up to the stage of Anagami, 
          and no further rebirth will therefore </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">take 
          place by entering into a mother's womb. He, will be elevated to reach 
          the Brahmaloka called Suddhavasa Abodes, and will become an Arahat, 
          and from there, will enter into Parinibbana. The meaning of it is unambiguous 
          up to that extent only. However, Lord Buddha wishes to see people reach 
          the stage of <i>arahatta-magga-phala </i>even in the present life existence 
          and attain the final goal of Nibbana on their demise. Therefore, based 
          on the matter of pregnancy which would require conceiving in a mother's 
          womb, some hold the presumption that all new existences or rebirths 
          have been rejected. It may be stated that this presumption appears appropriate 
          since it falls in line with the wish of the Buddha. However, it is pretty 
          difficult to make an interpretation to arrive at this meaning. In accordance 
          with the expression - <i>"kamesu,", </i>it may be possible to accept 
          the transliteration as "the desirable <i>rupa </i>and <i>arupa bhavas" 
          </i>without assuming the sense of the term <i>"'kamaguna". </i>Hence, 
          the meaning of the last two phrases may be furnished as follows:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Kamesu. 
          </i>In respect of all desirable sensations, <i>gedham - </i>the<i> </i>clinging 
          passionate attachment, <i>tanha, vinaya </i>- after rejecting with the 
          <i>four ariyamaggas, </i>nay, since rejection has been made, <i>gabbaseyya 
          - </i>coming<i> </i>into a new existence by entering into a mother's 
          womb such as, <i>patisandhi </i>(conception), <i>puna - </i>again<i>, 
          na hi jati eti - </i>will<i> </i>not surely happen, nay, will enter 
          into Parinibbana in this present life existence without having any more 
          rebirths.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          explanation is in consonance with the wish of the Buddha though it is 
          not in agreement with the usual translation from the viewpoint of grammar. 
          It also conforms to the statement that the five hundred Bhikkhus who, 
          after listening to this Metta Sutta Paritta, become Arahats through 
          meditation (in the same year <i>Vassa), </i>and then it falls in line 
          with the <i>desanas, </i>Noble Teachings, that it can reach up to the 
          stage of <i>Arahatta-magga-phala </i>by Vipassana contemplation based 
          upon <i>metta-jhana. </i>It is rational and natural and conventional 
          too. This explanation, therefore, is considered to be most appropriate.</font></p>

          Ashin Sariputta does not explain how Vipassana should be contemplated. 
          The former Pali expression <i>ekam disam</i> - could be interpreted 
          to mean - "one of the four regions of the East, West, South and 
          North". However, according to the usual way of radiating metta, 
          it must be construed as the region in the East. Let us therefore recite

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It is to radiate 
          <i>metta </i>towards all the Ten regions, with the Jhanic-mind called 
          <i>mahaggata </i>by developing <i>metta </i>only after attaining <i>metta-jhana. 
          </i>However, there is no fault in developing <i>metta </i>as such without 
          the attainment of <i>jhana. </i>It can accrue advantages as may be appropriate. 
          What are then the advantages? It may be stated as below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The derivation of 
          advantages from <i>kamavacara-metta kusala </i>by virtue of which, one 
          can sleep well, wake up from sleep happily and with joy, will have no 
          bad or horrible dreams, gain respect and love from both Devas and Humans, 
          and be free from dangers that might otherwise befall him in connection 
          with all Ten regions. Then also, if he is a Bhikkhu, he will prove himself 
          to be a noble and worthy recipient of <i>dana </i>(charity), and thereby' 
          causing the donor to achieve greater advantages. In making use of the 
          four requisites or properties concerning the Bhikkhus, he is released 
          from debt which he would otherwise be under obligation to repay. If 
          death occurs while developing <i>metta </i>with mindfulness, he will 
          be liberated from the Four Nether Worlds, and be reborn in the Abode 
          of<i> Sugati</i> - celestial or human worlds. I have therefore been 
          repeatedly giving you instructions to develop <i>metta </i>in order 
          to enable you to reap the fruits or advantages as already stated. Let 
          us recite in the form of a verse which will indicate how benefits can 
          be derived.</font></p>

          happily; (3) have no dreadful and bad dreams and will have only good 
          dreams, are clear enough and do not require elaboration. The next is 
          Number (4) Loved and respected by the public. In this connection, the

<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>(55) </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>The 
        Story of Rojamalla</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          one time, the Lord Buddha accompanied by one thousand, two hundred and 
          fifty disciples (Sangha) made His way to Kusinara from a place called 
          Apana. At that time, the ruling princes of Malla on hearing the news 
          of Buddha's proposed visit to Kusinara, issued a royal proclamation 
          that any person who failed to turn up and welcome the Buddha and his 
          Disciple Bhikkhus would be punished with a fine of five-hundred kyats. 
          On Buddha's arrival at Kusinara, Roja was one among the crowd who were 
          present to welcome the Buddha. He was an intimate friend of the Venerable 
          Ashin Ananda. When Ananda expressed his best wishes, being delighted 
          to see his friend Roja, saying it was very nice of him to give a hearty 
          welcome to the Lord Buddha, Roja was said to have replied as: I came 
          out to meet the Buddha not because I have great respect and reverence 
          for Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha, but because I fear I would have to pay 
          a penalty of five-hundred kyats which will be imposed upon me should 
          I fail to be present on this occasion of according reception to the 
          Buddha and his Disciples."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having 
          heard this reply, Ashin Ananda felt sorry and wondered what had made 
          Roja speak to him in that manner. Ashin Ananda then reflected, "Roja 
          is very rude and impolite. He is ignorant of the great value of advantages 
          that will be derived by paying his reverence to the triple Gem - Buddha, 
          Dhamma and Sangha. He would, therefore, lose all benefits which he should 
          have gained." After reflecting as such, Ashin Ananda appraised the Buddha 
          of this matter and respectfully put up that if Roja were bent upon giving 
          his best regards to this noble Sasana, he would have a lot of advantages.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thereupon, 
          Buddha exhorted Ashin Ananda to develop <i>metta bhavana </i>with his 
          concentration fixed firmly on Roja only. Usually Buddha developed and 
          radiated <i>Metta </i>equally on all beings. Buddha also used to radiate 
          his compassionate feelings evenly balanced towards all beings. However, 
          on this particular occasion, Buddha imagined thus: "This man Roja would 
          fail to gain merits as he should, if he does not take the opportunity 
          of paying his reverence despite his meeting with the Exalted One, personally." 
          He therefore, developed and put forth his <i>metta </i>concentrating 
          on Roja only. It is something like a beam of searchlight. If the rays 
          of the light were diffused, it would lose its brightness. If however, 
          the light is focussed on only one single narrow opening or object, it 
          would be very powerful and dazzling, something that resembles the light 
          emitted by the rays of the sun during daytime. Heat is also intense. 
          Similarly, when Buddha radiated His <i>metta </i>concentrating fixedly 
          on Roja alone instead of spreading out the rays of <i>metta </i>towards 
          all beings, it would be extremely powerful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The immediate reaction 
          was that a feeling of immense reverence had occurred in the mind of 
          Roja. It was stated that the mind which revered resembled that of a 
          newly born calf which had its deep and firm attachment to its mother 
          cow with intense love and devotion. Hence, Roja immediately left the 
          precincts of a small monastery to another and then another making his 
          way hither and thither in search of the Exalted One. Eventually as directed 
          by the Sanghas, he reached the perfumed Chamber of the premises where 
          the Buddha was residing. He then took his seat in the presence of the 
          Buddha worshipping and devotedly paying his obeisance. Buddha then gave 
          his due admonition and delivered a discourse relating to the virtues 
          of <i>dana, sila,</i> etc. After hearing the Sermon, he became a Sotapanna. 
          He even entreated the Buddha to let the Sanghas recognise him as their 
          benefactor and accept his offer of the four necessities relating to 
          the monks, namely, monastery, robes, food and medicine, and not to accept 
          offerings from others.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relying 
          on this incident, it is to be understood that if <i>metta is </i>developed 
          and radiated towards others with concentrated attention, it would have 
          a telepathic effect, and the recipients of <i>metta </i>would tend to 
          love and respect in reciprocity. Not only human beings but also animals 
          are likely to reciprocate love. Some time ago, a Home for the Aged had 
          published a magazine in which a peculiar incident was mentioned.</font></p>

          man by the name of U Ba Htu was a lover of animals and had a deep compassion 
          for them. Particularly, his sympathy went more for dogs. He used to 
          look after the dogs and feed them well. On certain days which he had 
          fixed earlier, he visited the dogs in the precincts of Kyaikkasan Pagoda, 
          cooked the meals and fed them. Whenever he came over to that place, 
          the dogs were said to have greeted him warmly. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          one time, U Ba Htu and his companions went on a pilgrimage to worship 
          Kaylasa and Myathabeik Pagodas situated near a place called Taungzun 
          in Kyaiktho Township. I had also been to these places and had spent 
          about three nights there. I also went round for alms in the villages 
          at the foot of the famous Kaylatha Hill. Dogs in these villages were 
          noted for their ferocity, they use to attack and bite the strangers 
          as a pack. If a person is going to visit a shrine up on the hill, he 
          has to pass through a village at the foot of the hill. When a party 
          of pilgrims led by U Ba Htu passed through the village, a pack of dogs 
          came running towards U Ba Htu. The villagers who were then watching 
          them with anxiety took it for granted that the dogs would attack U Ba 
          Htu. To their great astonishment, however, these dogs approached U Ba 
          Htu and greeted him by putting their forefeet up with love and affection 
          as if U Ba Htu was their beloved master. It is therefore to be surmised 
          that this had so happened because of love and compassion that was bestowed 
          upon dogs.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
          the lifetime of Lord Buddha, King Utena was the ruling monarch of the 
          State of Kosambi (rather, a City). He had three Queens; one of them 
          called Vasuladatta. She was the daughter of King Candapajjota, the Ruler 
          of Ujjeni State. The other queen's name was Samavati. She originally 
          belonged to Baddavati town and was the daughter of a millionaire named 
          Baddavati. Sometime, after the death of her parents, having been adopted 
          by Ghosaka, the rich, she was generally recognised as the daughter of 
          Ghosaka. The next queen bore the name of Magandi. She was the daughter 
          of a Brahmin by the name of Magandhi from the country of Kuru.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Magandi, 
          the Brahmin's daughter had a very fair complexion and was said to be 
          extremely attractive. Hence, a number of wealthy persons were stated 
          to have made proposals asking for her hands in marriage for their sons. 
          However, these proposals were turned down by Magandi's father on the 
          grounds that they were unworthy of acceptance for his beautiful daughter. 
          One day, this Brahmin Magandhi came across the Exalted One. Having noticed 
          the majestic features and lineaments of the Buddha, he considered Buddha 
          as being a worthy suitor for his daughter, and then asked the Buddha 
          not knowing who he was as: "0, Reverend Bhikkhu! I have a charming daughter. 
          I have been searching for a man deserving of giving marriage to my daughter 
          all throughout in the past, but to no avail. 0, Bhikkhu! You have the 
          manly qualities really worthy of my daughter's hands. I wish I could 
          offer my daughter to you. Could you please wait for a while at this 
          place?", said the Brahmin. He then immediately left the place in a hurry 
          and soon came back bringing his wife and daughter.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddha, 
          after leaving his footprint at that place where he met the Brahmin, 
          proceeded to another place not too far away from the place of their 
          meeting and stayed on. On their return to the site where they first 
          met, the Brahmin could only find the footprint of the Buddha. When he 
          told his wife that this was the footprint of the Bhikkhu he had met, 
          the wife, with her knowledge of the science of astrology remarked that 
          the owner of this footprint was a person who had already discarded the 
          sensual pleasures <i>(kamaguna), </i>or in other words, it was the footprint 
          of ' a man totally devoid of sensual pleasures and human passionate 
          desires. The Brahmin after telling his wife to keep her mouth shut, 
          followed the direction of the footprints implanted on the surface of 
          the earth, and eventually found the Enlightened One. He then addressed 
          the Buddha, "0 Ashin Bhikkhu I offer you my daughter to be your wife 
          and to be looked after by you."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddha before replying 
          to him as to whether he would accept the offer of the Brahmin's daughter 
          Magandi or not, recounted his life story beginning from His Great Renunciation 
          up to the time he settled down at the foot of Ajapala Bo (Bodhi) tree 
          after His Enlightenment, and as to how Mara, the Evil One, had been 
          shadowing him, or rather, investigating and keeping, constant vigilance 
          on him, When Mara, knew about Buddha's total emancipation from lusts 
          of the flesh and sensuality, he was put to mental distress with full 
          of anxiety. Mara's three daughters with a view to giving help to their 
          father, disguised themselves as beautiful divine maidens (female Devas) 
          and tried to allure and entice the Buddha. This was related to him, 
          by the Buddha. After that the Lord went on to explain how he had withstood 
          and eliminated <i>raga</i>, the worldly pleasures or desires, though 
          these very charming and fascinating daughters of Mara had tried to invoke 
          his passion, in the following words: </font></p>

          brief, it means: "No clinging sensual desire has occurred in me even 
          at the sight of the three daughters of Mara. Accordingly, there is hardly 
          anything to say in the case of your so-called beautiful daughter Magandi, 
          a worthless body full of loathsome filth, such as faeces and urine. 
          I'm not even inclined to touch her with my foot." After having heard 
          the Buddha's words both the parents of Magandi becoming mindful and 
          aware of the truth of the Dhamma, reached the stage of <i>anagami-phala 
          </i>and became Anagamis. These words, however, made Magandi, the daughter, 
          intolerable. She felt so bad and indignant that she bore a grudge against 
          the Exalted One from that time onwards. Bearing in mind that she was<i>
</i>purposely put to disgrace, she plotted with iniquity to take vengeance 
          upon Buddha at one time or the other when she got married to a person 
          of her own choice.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relating to this 
          incident, it seems reasonable t o raise a question as: "Doesn't Buddha 
          know that Magandi would bear a grudge out of resentment?" Yes, indeed, 
          Buddha was well aware of it. It has been explained in Dhammapada Commentary 
          that the Exalted One uttered these words of truth purposely knowing 
          fully well that only by teaching in that manner her parents would attain 
          <i>anagami-phala </i>and that the speech was delivered after due consideration 
          of the benefits which would be derived by them as against the vengeance 
          which was sure to be hatched against him by Magandi.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having been liberated

          Buddha's Sasana. Later, after continuous exercise of intense meditation, 
          they became Arahats. Sometime afterwards, Magandis uncle offered his 
          niece's hand to King Utena. The King made her his Chief Queen.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At

          had also erected a monastery and offered it in donation to the Exalted 
          One, while another millionaire Pavarika offered a monastery called Pavarikarama. 
          Buddha, in response to the invitation of these three millionaires, proceeded 
          to Kosambhi State and resided in the three monasteries by turns. The

          a Sotapanna.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
          was stated that usually Khujjuttara bought only four kyats worth of 
          flowers out of eight kyats given for her from the King's coffers, keeping 
          four kyats for her own personal use. On that particular day since she 
          had become a Sotapanna,' she had absolutely no intention to steal other 
          people's property. She therefore bought eight kyats worth of flowers. 
          Seeing the flowers much more than that had been usually found, Samavatl 
          inquired, "O, Sister! Did the King give you double the amount of money 
          that was ordinarily given to purchase the flowers particularly today?" 
          To this query, Khujjuttara replied, "No, Madam, certainly not." "Why 
          then there are flowers about twice as many as were usually the Case?" 
          asked the Queen. Khujjuttara admitted: "Usually on previous occasions, 
          I pocketed four kyats, and only bought four kyats worth of flowers. 
          Today, I had bought flowers to the full value of all eight kyats." This 
          was a candid reply by abstaining herself from telling lies or falsehood. 
          This manner of reply deserves paying attention. Simply because, in those 
          ancient times, a Queen had full and absolute powers to the extent of 
          imposing a capital punishment on any person whom she disliked or considered 
          guilty. The Queen could possibly give orders to execute Khujjuttara 
          for having committed theft of the money paid to buy flowers, or rather, 
          for the offence of is appropriation. However, Khujjuttara had spoken 
          the truth and nothing but the truth without fear of the consequences 
          that might befall her. This noble and honest attitude in telling the 
          truth is the courageous attribute of sotapattimagga, the Special Dhamma. 
          Further interrogations made as to why she did not slice off half the 
          amount of money given to her on that day, Khujjuttara replied that it 
          as because she had gained the Special Dhamma, the wakening of the higher 
          consciousness of the Dhamma after listening to the sermon delivered 
          by the Buddha.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Samavati 
          then reflected with her right devotion of mind that to become purified 
          in mind without any intention to steal was indeed marvellous. She imagined 
          that this Dhamma must be really noble. This kind of thought could only 
          occur in the mind of a virtuous person. If the person vicious and wicked 
          and not virtuous, anger would have risen in him or her, particularly 
          in such a case like this en it was known that the other had stolen or 
          misappropriated the money given for the purpose of buying flowers. Samavati, 
          however, being a person with a virtuous mind with her background perfection, 
          was elated to find her aid-servant cleansed of vice, and equipped with 
          the noble Special Dhamma. A keen desire with a feeling of enthusiasm 
          having pervaded Samavati, she entreated Khujjuttara, "O, my elder sister! 
          We also wish to hear and share the Special Dhamma which you said you 
          have achieved. Please explain to us." Khujjuttara in reply requested 
          to let her take a bath to keep her body clean before she preached the 
          spotlessly purified Dhamma. Khujjuttara was therefore permitted to bathe 
          with scented water and wear a complete outfit of dress made of a very 
          fine texture. Khujjuttara then put on a piece of garment round her waist 
          and wrapped herself up with another piece of cloth in the upper portion 
          of her body above the waist letting a part of the garment rest upon 
          one shoulder while leaving the other shoulder bare - (<i>ekamsam</i>
<i>paru pitva). </i>Later, she took her seat on the allotted place. 
          With a peculiar kind of glittering fan called <i>'citrabijani.' </i>held 
          in her hands, she beckoned the five hundred maids-of-honour batch by 
          batch and gave them her teaching. While listening to the Dhamma taught 
          by Khujjuttara with utmost concentration, they devotedly contemplated 
          and noted with diligence. For having immersed themselves in Vipassana 
          Dhamma, higher awakening consciousness had arisen in them that led to 
          their attainment of <i>sotapatti-phala. </i>Samavati and all her maids-of-honour 
          totalling two hundred and fifty in number became Sotapannas.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thence, 
          all of them after paying homage to Khujjuttara requested, "0, Sister! 
          Effective from today please relinquish this lowly and mean duties of 
          a maidservant and assume the role of our mother and teacher. Then, please 
          be kind enough to visit the Buddha daily and listen to the sermon delivered 
          by the Enlightened One. Thereafter, please impart to us the Dhamma you 
          have heard." Therefore, Khujjuttara went to pay obeisance to the Lord 
          Buddha everyday and listened to His noble teaching. On her return, she 
          recounted the Dhamma with wonderful precision as had been heard and 
          remembered by her. Having had her Special Perfection <i>(paramitas), 
          </i>she remembered all what had been taught by the Buddha and could 
          impart the teachings exactly in the same, manner, as were delivered 
          by the Enlightened One both in modulation of the voice, accent and tone. 
          Even nowadays, some people could imitate the style of teaching done 
          by the teachers in demeanour, mode of delivery, pitch and rhythm. This 
          appears possible because of their <i>piramitas. </i>On the part of Khujjuttara, 
          she had prayed for attainment of this Special attribute in the past 
          hundred thousand kappas. That is why she later became an outstanding 
          intellectual well versed and fully accomplished in the Three Baskets 
          of the Buddhist-Scriptures <i>(tipitakadhara). </i>Some time later, 
          she was conferred upon by the Buddha the pre-eminent title of Etadagga, 
          the foremost rank among the learned female disciples (Bhikkhunis) unrivalled 
          in the knowledge of the Scriptures and in possessing the ability to 
          expound them.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Five 
          hundred maids-of-honour led by Samavati then requested Khujjuttara to 
          find ways and means to enable them to worship the Buddha and the Sanghas. 
          It is pretty difficult for those residing in the King's Palace to meet 
          outsiders. As such, Khujjuttara gave them advice to make small holes 
          in the walls of the upper storey of the palace building to enable them 
          to see through these holes when Buddha and his sanghas came walking 
          along the road on their way to the residential mansions of the millionaires 
          (benefactors) living in the pity to take meals on invitation. This advice 
          which was accepted and implemented, enabled the Queen and her maids 
          to peep through the small holes at the time when Buddha and his company 
          of disciples, walked past.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One 
          day, when Magandi saw by chance the small holes in the wall of the King's 
          Palace, she inquired as to why the wall had been so perforated with 
          small holes. Samavati and her maids not knowing that Magandi had her 
          grievance and grudge against the Buddha, told her that the Exalted One 
          was presently residing in the City, and that these were the holes through 
          which they looked furtively to revere and worship the Buddha when He 
          wended his way along the road down below. When she got that information, 
          it occurred to Magandi, "Oh! the monk Gotama has come over to this City 
          to stay. I will have to do what should be done. These womenfolk are 
          those who revere the monk Gotama. I'll also have to deal with them as 
          may be considered proper." Imagining as such, she made a slanderous 
          talk to let the King know that Simavati and her followers were trying 
          to win the love of outsiders and were bent upon coaxing them and would 
          therefore sooner or later conspire to assassinate His Majesty the King. 
          The King however, did not believe her malicious gossip though she had 
          repeated as first stated, three times in succession.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">She, 
          therefore, told the King, "If Your Majesty doesn't believe what I have 
          said, you may please visit the main building of the palace and see for 
          yourself as to what is actually happening." The King then made his way 
          to the said building and had a look round inside the palace. He found 
          the small holes in the wall and in making his enquiry as to why these 
          were so perforated, came to know that these holes were meant to be peeped 
          through to see the Lord Buddha and to revere the Lord. He was unperturbed. 
          Although the King caused these holes to be patched up and closed, he 
          let new fanlights be fixed up. The fanlights being much better than 
          the tiny holes, it gave delight to Samavati and her retinue. Failing 
          in her attempt to disparage Samavati and her maids-of-honour, Magandi 
          put a cobra, after its fangs had been extracted, inside the hollow space 
          of the King's royal harp, and covered up that opening with a wreath 
          of flowers, when time was due for the King to make his rounds to the 
          Chamber where Samavati resided.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After 
          carrying out her plan as stated, Magandi coaxed the King saying that 
          it was not advisable for His Majesty to visit Samavati on the grounds 
          that she had had her bad dreams which portended ill-omen. Nevertheless, 
          King Utena did not fail to call on Samavati at her private chamber according 
          to the program he had mapped out. On that occasion, Magandi accompanied 
          the King as if she was worried about his safety. After his arrival there, 
          the King had his ' meals served by Samavati-1 and the chamber maids, 
          and later, placing his harp at the top of the golden couch, he lay down 
          on it to take a rest. Meanwhile, Magandi loitered about the couch and 
          surreptitiously removed the wreath of flowers which served as a cover 
          to the hollow space in the harp. Then came the cobra sliding out from 
          inside the harp and remained on the sleeping couch raising its venomous 
          hood. Seeing the snake, Magandi raised an alarm seemingly in terror 
          as: "Tut! Tut! Your Majesty! Snake! Snake!", uttering at the same time 
          obscene words against the King and Samavati and then, continued to talk 
          rudely as: "This stupid King is inglorious, ignoble and a dullard as 
          well. He refused to believe my words. These stupid and wicked bunch 
          of maids also have no morality and are simply rascals. Is there anything 
          that has so far been denied to you all by the King? I have had a horrible 
          dream last night. Despite my warnings not to visit the Chamber of Samavati, 
          Your Majesty had, refused to listen to my sincere advice, etc."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          King when faced with an imminent danger of death that could be brought 
          about by the venomous snake, believed what Magandi had spoken ill of 
          Samavati. Vehement anger had arisen in him too. Hence, orders were immediately 
          given to shoot Samavati and her five hundred maids with poisonous arrows 
          and kill them on the spot. Samavati and her followers were then directed 
          to sit in a row to take the punishment. Samavati advised her maids, 
          "0, Sisters! At this critical moment we have nothing to rely upon except 
          <i>metta. </i>You<i> </i>all may shower upon the King and Magandi your 
          feeling of <i>metta </i>wholeheartedly, spreading your loving kindness 
          evenly balanced on them. You may also prevent your anger from arising." 
          So saying, Samavati sat in the forefront of all her maids-of-honour 
          and started developing and radiating <i>metta </i>to the best of their 
          ability. King Utena personally picked up the bow and arrow and shot 
          directly at Samavati.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
          was stated that the arrow which was shot from the bow instead of going 
          straight to the target rebounded towards King Utena as if it were about 
          to pierce through his breast and then dropped short in front of him 
          on the surface. When it so happened, repentance immediately came upon 
          the King. Then uttering, "Alas! the arrow which I had shot sould have 
          pierced even through a thick marble slab, and yet this arrow recoiled 
          and came back directly to me as if it were about to hit me. Even a lifeless 
          thing like an arrow knows the gratitude and noble attributes of. the 
          queen, Samavati. How regretful it is that a, human being like me has 
          failed to appreciate her noble qualities...", he threw away his bow. 
          The King then kneeled down before Samavati and respectfully begged of 
          her to pardon him, saying:</font></p>

          hearing this reply, His Majesty the King Utena admitted, "Very well, 
          Oh my beloved! I pay my homage and deep respect to you and also have 
          great reverence for the Buddha. I offer you anything you may wish to 
          have." Afterwards, the King made his way to the Enlightened One and 
          took refuge in the three Jewels of Buddhism, viz: Buddha, Dhamma and 
          Sangha. He invited the Sanghas led by the Buddha to his grand Palace, 
          and for seven days continuously, he resorted to alms-giving or charity 
          on an immense scale. He also asked Samavati to mention her wish so as 
          to enable him to fulfil her desire according to the promise already 
          given. Thereupon, Samavati besought the King to permit her to offer 
          alms to the Buddha and Sanghas everyday. King Utena then personally 
          went to the Enlightened One and requested the Buddha as desired by his 
          queen. The Buddha in response to the King's invitation, sent the Venerable 
          Ashin Ananda together with five hundred of his monk disciples. From 
          that time onwards, Samavati and her maids-of-honour, five hundred in 
          number, had had an opportunity to do charity, offer meals; pay homage

        Story of Sihabahu</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ceylonese 
          history refers to a story of a man by the name of Sihabahu, born of 
          a princess with her conjugal relationship with a lion. On attaining 
          the age of sixteen, this young man asked his mother, "Why is it that 
          you, mother, are different in race from my father?". The mother recounted 
          what had happened as: "I'm the daughter of the King of the Country of 
          Vanga. At one time, on my way to the State of Magadha together with 
          other travellers, we all came upon this great lion. The whole crowd 
          of travellers except me fled in fear. I was however unable to lift my 
          feet and run away for my life, exactly as was once formerly predicted 
          by an astrologer that I would have my conjugal relationship with a lion. 
          The prophecy was confirmed by a miraculous event in this way.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          I remained at a standstill with fright, this great lion carried me on 
          his back and took me away into a cave where he lived. Sihabahu then 
          inquired why she continued to remain in the cave without returning to 
          the palace where her own kith and kin were residing. She told her son 
          that she was unable to leave the cave because the mouth of the cave 
          was blocked up with a huge massive rock. Thereupon, Sihabahu removed 
          this huge rock and left the place carrying his mother and sister on 
          his shoulder.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
          return to his den, the great lion not seeing his wife and children felt 
          dejected and went out in search of them. He attacked all people living 
          in the outskirts of the villages where he set his foot. On receipt of 
          complaint from the people concerned about the ravages done by the lion, 
          the King of Vanga issued a royal proclamation that any person who could 
          suppress this enemy, the lion, would be offered a reward of three thousand 
          kyats. Sihabahu came forward to undertake the task of killing the lion. 
          His mother twice prevented her son from doing harm to the lion, his 
          own father. On the third time, without the knowledge of his mother, 
          Sihabahu accepted the award. On his arrival before the King, the latter 
          promised that he would surrender his Kingdom to Sihabahu, if Sihabahu 
          could quell the danger brought about by this great lion. He therefore 
          left the palace and proceeded to where the lion could be traced. The 
          great lion, being greatly touched with an instinctive paternal love, 
          on seeing his son, was developing his lovingkindness. The arrows which 
          were shot at the lion by Sihabahu had no effect on the lion, and these 
          arrows were said to have rebounded and dropped before him near his foot 
          by virtue of <i>metta</i> that had been developed and radiated towards 
          the son. Three attempts were made to kill the lion in the like manner, 
          but in all his attempts, all arrows bounded back to Sihabahu and dropped 
          on the earth before him. Because of repeated attacks by his son, a feeling 
          of anger and bitterness had arisen in the great lion. Hence, the arrow 
          which was shot on the fourth occasion hit the lion and pierced through 
          its body. Judging from this incident, it is to be borne in mind that

        The </font><font size="3">Story of Suvannasama</font></b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relating 
          to the advantages of <i>metta </i>stated in the foregoing, explanation 
          given to the query put forward will be found in Milindapanha Pali Text. 
          The question that arose was: In mentioning the eleven advantages of 
          <i>metta </i>it has been stated that "a person who is developing <i>metta 
          </i>will escape bodily injury, or in other words, will be immune from 
          the dangers of fire, poison, etc." However, in the story of Suvannasama 
          Jataka, mention has been made that though Suvannasama was said to be 
          always developing <i>metta, </i>he was badly wounded and was in a state 
          of semi-consciousness because of the injury caused by the poisonous 
          arrow which was shot at him by the King Piliyakkha while hunting deer 
          to find out the truth of what he considered as a strange thing. Such 
          being the case, the statement that Suvannasama had been hit by the arrow 
          must be wrong if the statement that no harm or injury could be inflicted 
          by a weapon on a person who was developing <i>metta. </i>On the other 
          hand, if the statement that Suvannasama was actually hit by an arrow, 
          then, the statement that "a person who is developing <i>metta </i>becomes 
          invulnerable", must be wrong. Since these two statements were conflicting 
          and were contrary to one another, King Milinda requested Ashin </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Nagasena 
          to kindly clarify the two opposite views or the discrepancies.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To 
          this problematic matter in issue, Ashin Nagasena Thera explained as 
          follows:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"0, 
          noble King Milinda! It is exactly true that no weapon can hit or harm 
          a person who is developing <i>metta. </i>It is also true that Suvannasama 
          was hit by an arrow. Though both are, in fact, correct, the reason for 
          having no discrepancy between the two statements is that the advantage 
          of invulnerability is derived not because of the inherent power or quality 
          of the person but because of the attributes or quality of <i>metta. 
          </i>Although it had been stated that Suvannasama was developing <i>metta 
          </i>at the time when he was struck by the arrow, he was picking up the 
          water-pot, and it was during that brief moment of interval Suvannasama 
          had a break or a lapse in the process of developing <i>metta. </i>That 
          is the reason why he was struck by an arrow."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
          example, in ancient times, soldiers had an armoured suit made of metal 
          steel. When such an armour was worn in fighting as a covering in defence, 
          no arrow or spear could pierce through it. It served as a protection 
          against sharp weapons. The escape from injury caused by a weapon, such 
          as, spear, arrow or a sword, is because of the faculty of the armoured 
          suit. It is not attributable to the inherent power or faculty of the 
          man. If this suit of armour is not worn by a person, any kind of weapon 
          used against him would have caused an injury. In the same way, immunity 
          from such lethal weapons should be attributed to the faculty of <i>metta 
          </i>and not to that of the person. Hence, at the moment of a lapse from 
          <i>metta </i>development, Suvannasama was struck by the arrow.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          second example is that a person living in a sound masonry building will 
          not get wet by rains. This is not due to his faculty but the inherent 
          quality of the building itself. If he lacks shelter and stays outside 
          the building, he, will be soaked to the skin. Similarly, if a person 
          is lacking in <i>metta, </i>any kind of weapon could harm him at the 
          moment of his lapse in the development of <i>metta, </i>just as a man 
          who will get soaked if he were outside the building when raining.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          next example may be cited. This is what is called a "medicinal tree 
          of an angel". It is stated that a person who was holding its branch, 
          or any part of its wood, would become invisible to the naked eye. It 
          had the power of making a man "Invisible". There is every likelihood 
          that people nowadays may find it difficult to believe such a miracle. 
          However, I have made a mention of it according .to what is found in 
          the Text of Milindapanha. Invisibility is the power of this "Medicinal 
          Tree of an Angel", and not of the man. The main significance which I 
          want to stress is to constantly develop <i>metta, </i>if you want to 
          protect yourself from any kind of danger.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Relating 
          to No. (7) of the eleven advantages that can be accrued from <i>metta 
          </i>in connection with the invulnerability from fire, poison and weapons 
          etc.", nothing more is required to be said. Regarding No. (8) speedily 
          becomes the mind serene, (9) facial complexion is bright and sparkling 
          with joy, and (10) without gloom and anxiety on the verge of death, 
          it does not appear necessary to be repeated. What now remains to be 
          said is connected with No. (11) "verily destined to become a Brahma", 
          the last of the advantages. This advantage is clearly mentioned in the 
          Pali Texts. Under the sub-heading "Second Metta Sutta" appearing in 
          the beginning of Part IV of this Dhamma, the method of Vipassana meditation 
          to be jointly exercised has been shown. This will again be clarified 
          now.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          above describes the manner of contemplating Vipassana after arising 
          from the trance of <i>jhana. </i>What is contemplated is on <i>rupa 
          </i>and <i>vedana, </i>etc., as and when they occur at the moment of 
          his absorption in <i>jhana. </i>It is something which is similar to 
          what the present Yogis are contemplating and noting as "seeing", "hearing", 
          or, "imagining" after the arising consciousness of what is seen, heard 
          or imagined. At the time when the Jhanic-mind occurs, <i>rupa </i>or 
          matter, on which the Jhanic-mind depends, is present. It is extremely 
          pure, refined and good. As these good sensations have pervaded the whole 
          body, one would feel very comfortable and nice. It is similar to the 
          characteristics of consciousness or knowledge which occurs at the moment 
          of achieving <i>udayabbaya-nana. </i>This <i>rupa </i>on which reliance 
          is made and rupas-material elements or sense-objects which have taken 
          place by virtue of <i>jhana</i> are mentioned in Pali Texts as <i>"yadeva 
          rupagatam" Vedana,</i> etc., which occur hand in hand simultaneously 
          and in combination with the Jhanic-mind have been mentioned as <i>"vedanagatam, 
          sannagatam and sankharagatam"</i> - The Jhanic-mind is, however, described 
          as <i>"vinnanagatam"</i> This is how a person who has attained <i>jhana</i>, 
          contemplates on the Jhanic-mind, etc. This resembles the manner of contemplating 
          and noting the arising consciousness of imagination as "imagining", 
          when it occurs, by the present Yogis.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How 
          awareness and perception is gained by insight knowledge through contemplation 
          as has been stated, is shown as, <i>"aniccato"</i>, etc., totalling 
          eleven kinds. A person who is endowed with special or deeper knowledge 
          can grasp all the eleven characteristics or conditions. A person who 
          is lacking in knowledge cannot realise all of them. He may know only 
          a few. The most significant point, however, is to know the true characteristics 
          of <i>anicca, dukkha and anatta</i>. Hence, the Buddha has taught laying 
          emphasis on these three kinds, viz: <i>anicca, dukkha and anatta</i>. 
          If these three marks are truly perceived and known, the rest of the 
          eight can also be understood. For instance, palace - easily destructible 
          - carries the same sense as <i>anicca</i>, impermanence or not lasting. 
          It is similar to (1) a virulent-type of disease, (2) a chronic malignant 
          tumour, (3) a sharp-pointed stump that has struck or pierced through, 
          (4) <i>agha</i> - not free from suffering, nay, it can bring evil just 
          like vice or demerit, (5) the five conditions which are said to be similar 
          to illness are all <i>dukkha</i> - suffering. (1) <i>Para</i> - it resembles 
          a stranger, (2) <i>Sunna</i> - it is devoid of '<i>atta"</i> ' a being, 
          or individuality. The said two also convey the same meaning as '<i>anatta'</i> 
          -non-self or ungovernable. That is why I have now, explained the manner 
          by which the nature or characteristics of <i>anicca,</i> <i>dukkha </i>and 
          <i>anatta </i>can be known and realised.</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
          things are impermanent if they arise instantly followed by dissolution. 
          For example, a house is constructed in an open field. Is it not a house 
          which has sprung up anew though it has not existed before? Yes, it is. 
          Is it not subjected to decay for the simple reason that one day or the 
          other, or with the passage of time, it will meet with destruction? Shall 
          we therefore say it is everlasting, or impermanent? If a thing appears 
          and then again disappears, it is undoubtedly impermanent and transitory. 
          In 'the same way, a person is born into this world as what is called 
          his life existence. He has come into being afresh, but will one day 
          pass away or die. He, as a living being, is no doubt impermanent and 
          not lasting. Likewise, it resembles a flash of lightning which appears 
          and vanishes all of a sudden. These are the examples of the transient 
          nature or the characteristic of <i>anicca.</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
          Yogi who is contemplating and noting will perceive the manifestations

          by dissolution at every moment of his noting when his power of concentration 
          <i>(samadhi) </i>becomes strong. Such happenings will be realised with 
          his own personal insight-knowledge. He will become elated with joy that 
          everything which occurs, passes away instantaneously. This is the characteristic 
          of <i>anicca. </i>When awareness takes place while contemplating that 
          things have arisen and disappeared all at once, he will come to realise 
          that these are all "Impermanence". This knowledge or awareness is <i>"aniccanupassana-nana."</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This

          a person is said to be absorbed in <i>metta-jhana, </i>he is actually

          immersing himself thus, the <i>metta</i> Jhanic-mind occurs wishing 
          others happy. This Jhanic-mind may last for a second, or a few minutes. 
          When this Jhanic-mind ceases, then usual sensuous thoughts or desires 
          will appear or arise. This is to be called as "rising from <i>jhana. 
          " </i>It is something like waking up from a deep slumber. If the Yogi 
          who plunges himself in a trance of <i>jhana </i>bearing in mind or with 
          pre-determination that he will carry on with Vipassana contemplation 
          after rising from <i>jhana, </i>the moment Jhanic-mind ceases, contemplative 
          mind with awareness - Vipassana - consciousness will take place. He 
          knows distinguishably the arising consciousness of Vipassana and the 
          cessation of the Jhanic-mind. It is not that the Jhanic-mind singly 
          is known. The simultaneous arising and dissolution of <i>rupa, vedana, 
          sanna </i>and <i>sankharas </i>are also known and realised. He clearly

          is <i>"Anatta"? </i>It means: <i>"Yam dukkham tadanatta - </i>the<i> 
          dukkha dhamma, </i>as taught by the Buddha. Hence, the five <i>khandhas 
          </i>which are called <i>"dukkha" </i>is not <i>"atta ", </i>a living 
          entity. It is Non-Self, the <i>"anatta" </i>It is unmanageable and cannot 
          be coaxed to become happy inasmuch as it's inherent nature is "suffering". 
          Since it is unmanageable and uncontrollable, it cannot be called or 
          regarded as One's Own 'Self'. As such, <i>Anatta </i>is a condition 
          which is ungovernable, Let's recite a Motto which embraces the said 
          meaning:</font></p>

          one's own wish, and are ungovernable, it should be noted and realised 
          as "Non-Self" and Not as <i>"Atta". </i>Hence, it has been stated as 
          merely the characteristic <i>of anatta </i>and as a condition, uncontrollable 
          and unmanageable, which would not happen according to one's own wish, 
          i.e. <i>(avasavuttana karo anattalakkhanam). </i>The Motto is couched

          he realises distinguishably with his own personal insight-knowledge

          if serious contemplation is made so as to realise the marks of anicca, 
          etc., by reciting from the innermost heart as: "May all be happy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Contemplation made

</i>nothing but contemplating on <i>mahaggata-kusala </i>mind, i.e., 
          the state of mind that is highly meritorious, etc. The only difference 
          is between the nature of <i>kamavacara</i> and that of <i>mahaggata-jhana, 
          i</i>.e., lofty or extensive <i>jhana. </i>The manner of contemplating 
          <i>metta </i>is, however, identical. Hence, while contemplating the 
          virtuous thought of <i>metta</i>, etc., when <i>vipassana-nana </i>becomes 
          strengthened, Nibbana - the state of complete extinction of <i>rupa</i> 
          and <i>nama</i> - will be realised through <i>ariya</i> <i>magga-nana</i>. 
          Following this <i>magga-nana,</i> the knowledge of fruition (<i>phala</i>) 
          will be attained. If such attainment is accomplished, one will at least 
          become a Sotapanna. A person who has achieved <i>metta-jhana, if </i>he 
          continues to contemplate and note, will attain Nibbana through the achievement 
          of stage of <i>Sakadagami-magga-phala </i>and<i> Anagami-magga-phala</i>. 
          In most cases Anagamiship is attained. If he becomes an Anagami by faculty 
          of which he or she is entirely free from <i>kamaraga</i> (human passionate 
          desires), he will no longer reach the abode of <i>karma</i>. Rebirth 
          will take place only in the abodes of <i>rupavacara</i> and <i>arupavacara</i>, 
          It is very likely that he or she may have his or her next existence 
          in <i>rupavacara</i> abode called Suddhavasa.</font></p>

          - </i>unlike<i> </i>the majority of worldlings, <i>asadharana - </i>is

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          this regard, since it has been stated as reaching the Abode of Suddhavasa, 
          it is also necessary to attain the Fourth <i>jhana. </i>By developing 
          <i>metta bhavana, </i>only the Third <i>jhana </i>can be attained. As 
          such, a question may arise as to how it could reach Suddhavasa Abode. 
          It may be answered that after becoming an Anagami by contemplating <i>metta-jhana, 
          </i>the Fourth <i>jhana </i>is<i> </i>achieved through <i>upekkha bhava</i>na. 
          To achieve as such is not difficult for an Anagami. It is quite easy. 
          Even a person, who has become an Anagami through Vipassana contemplation 
          without the attainment of any <i>jhana </i>can easily achieve up to 
          the Fourth <i>jhana </i>and reach the Abode of Suddhavasa. Hence, it 
          should be understood that Suddhavasa Abode has been reached after attainment 
          of the Fourth <i>jhana </i>through the exercise of <i>upekkha bhavana.</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          so far as an ordinary worldling is concerned, although he has attained 
          <i>metta-jhana </i>and <i>upekkha-jhana, </i>he cannot possibly reach 
          the Abode of Suddhavasa. That is why the existence or rebirth in Suddhavasa 
          Abode is not connected with, or rather, beyond the reach of ordinary 
          worldlings <i>(Puthujjanas)</i>. Is it not true that Sotapannas and 
          Sakadagamis cannot also be reborn in Suddhavasa Abode? Then the question 
          may arise as to why it is not mentioned: that it does not concern Sotapannas 
          and Sakadagamis. It is true that Sotapannas and Sakadagamis cannot be 
          reborn in Suddhavasa. However, they can easily achieve Anagamiship and 
          then, reach Suddhavasa. As such, it may be understood that it has been 
          mentioned as, not connected with only ordinary worldlings who have no 
          chance of becoming in Suddhavasa.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
          has now been taught relates to the Second Metta Sutta as contained in 
          Anguttara Nikaya, Fourth Nipata. In the First Metta Sutta, however, 
          it is stated that if death takes place as an ordinary worldling after 
          attainment of <i>metta-Jhana, </i>he will, by virtue of his achievement 
          of <i>jhana, </i>be reborn in the abodes of First <i>jhana, </i>of Second 
          <i>jhana, </i>of Third <i>jhana </i>and <i>vehapphalo </i>(the tenth 
          Abode of Brahmaloka), and then, on expiry of the life-span in these 
          abodes, he will be reverted to <i>kamasugati </i>after his death; and 
          also there is every possibility of his descending to the Four Nether 
          Worlds. However, in the case of a person who has become an Ariya he 
          will become an Arahat in that Brahmaloka from where he will enter into 
          Parinibbana. To be able to revere it, further elucidation will be made

          when death takes place after attaining the Third <i>Metta Jhana, </i>the

          expires, he will be relegated to the life existence of the human world

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These

          of either <i>apaya</i> or animal or <i>Peta</i> for not being free as 
          yet from <i>kamma</i> and <i>kilesa</i>. One cannot, of course, reach 
          the world of <i>Apayas</i> immediately after demise from the Brahma 
          World. It is because of the meritorious result or <i>kamma</i> of <i>upacara-samadhi 
          </i>which he had developed and by virtue of which he had. achieved jhana 
          to be elevated to the World of Brahmas. With this achievement, a person

          and then, may possibly be reborn in the World of Animals or of <i>Petas; 
          </i>but as regards an Ariya-savaka who has achieved <i>metta-jhana, 
          </i>he will first come into being as a Brahma, and only in that Brahmaloka, 
          will attain Arahatship and then finally enter into <i>Parinibbana. </i>These 
          are the two kinds, <i>viveso - </i>which<i> </i>have the distinctive 
          features.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
          is required to be known according to the First Metta Sutta which has 
          just been stated, is that if one is contented with the mere achievement 
          of this <i>metta-jhana </i>which he has attained, he will reach the 
          Abode of Brahmas after his demise. However, since he has not yet achieved 
          <i>ariya-magga-phala, </i>the Special Dhamma, for failing to contemplate 
          Vipassana he will surely be reverted to the world of human beings or 
          of Devas when the life-span in' Brahmaloka expires. Then, after so becoming, 
          if, he has committed evil deeds that can bring him down to the Nether 
          Worlds, he will again descend to the four <i>Apayas. </i>Hence, despite 
          the fact that he has reached the Brahmaloka by virtue of his attainment 
          of <i>jhana, </i>he will be in the same boat as other ordinary worldlings 
          who are still liable to go down to the four Nether Worlds. However, 
          if Sotapanna is achieved in the least, after his attainment of <i>metta-jhana 
          </i>through Vipassana contemplation, he will reach the Brahmaloka after 
          his death, and will not be reborn in the world of sensual pleasures, 
          and will eventually become an Arahat in that Brahma Abode whereby all 
          miseries will come to an end. Although such a person is not an Anagami, 
          he will not be reborn in the world of sensual pleasures since <i>kamaraga 
          </i>has been dispelled by him with the faculty of <i>jhana. </i>He is 
          called a <i>Jhana-Anagami</i>. Similarly, a Sakadagami who has already 
          achieved <i>jhana, will </i>never be reborn in Kamaloka. He too is known, 
          as a <i>'Jhana-Anagami'.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If, however, a person 
          becomes an Anagami after attainment of <i>jhana, </i>there is an opportunity 
          for him to enter into Parinibbana as an Arahat in the lowest abode of 
          Aviha, one of the five abodes of Suddhavasa, where he will be reborn 
          as mentioned in the Second Metta Sutta. If he fails to gain Arahatship 
          after the expiry of a life-span of two thousand <i>kappas </i>in that 
          Abode, he will have his rebirth in the third elevated abode called Sudassa 
          from among the Abode of Suddhavasa.' There are cases in which Parinibbana 
          had taken place after becoming an Arahat in that abode. If no Arahaship 
          is achieved as yet, he will land in the fourth abode called Sudassi 
          on expiry of the life-span of thousand <i>kappas</i>. In that abode 
          too, there are instances of persons entering into Parinibbana after 
          the attainment of Arahatship. If no Arahatship is achieved, rebirth 
          will take place in the highest <i>Akanittha Abode </i>after the life-span 
          of eight thousand kappas has exhausted. However, Arahatship will definitely 
          be attained in that abode and when its lifespan of sixteen thousand 
          <i>kappas </i>comes to an end final attainment of <i>Nibbana (Parinibbana) 
          </i>is<i> </i>sure to come.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now 
          that elucidation made in connection with the eleventh advantage with 
          reference to Anguttara Pali Texts has been fairly completed. In Anguttara 
          Pali (3rd 542) it has been preached as: <i>"uttari appati vijjhanto 
          brahmalokupago hoti." </i>The<i> </i>Commentary has given an exposition 
          of this Pali phrase as: <i>Mettasamapattito - </i>attainment<i> </i>of 
          <i>metta-jhana, uttari </i>- beyond that, <i>arahattam adhigantum - 
          </i>to achieve arahatta-phala; <i>asakkonto - </i>a<i> </i>person who 
          is incompetent, <i>itocavitva - on </i>expiry of this human life existence, 
          <i>suttappabuddho viya - </i>like<i> </i>a person who has risen from 
          sleep <i>brahmalokam upapajjati - </i>reaches. the Brahma World.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          this I regard, the expression - "if <i>Arahatta-phala </i>cannot be 
          reached beyond the attainment of <i>metta-jhana", </i>embraces all what 
          have, been stated as: "if there is achievement of <i>metta-jhana </i>only, 
          one can reach the Brahmaloka and also "Brahmaloka can be reached by 
          attainment of any one or two or all three of the lower stages of <i>phala 
          </i>based upon the endowment of <i>metta-jhana". </i>Hence, in the motto 
          which described the advantages of <i>metta, </i>it is, stated as, 'Happy 
          in sleep and in waking . . . varily destined to become a Brahma; all, 
          constituting eleven attributes in number are the advantages accrued 
          from<i> </i>developing <i>metta.</i></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>(67) </b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>What 
          is meant by Karuna</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Karuna </i>means 
          "compassion" in plain Burmese. This Burmese terminology (Thaner-gyin 
          which means 'compassion' in English), is not mingled with any other 
          sense of expression. It is quite precise. <i>Metta</i> in Burmese should 
          be translated as "Love". This term "love" is mixed 
          up with <i>raga </i>- passionate feeling of attachment. In fact, <i>metta</i> 
          means wishing others to be blessed with happiness. On the other hand, 
          "compassion" i.e. <i>karuna</i>, is not mingled with any other 
          sense. It is exact and definite. It conveys the same sense as: "wishing 
          a person who is in trouble, to be free from suffering or misery". 
          That is the reason why the intrinsic quality and characteristic of the 
          term "<i>karuna</i>" is explained in the Visuddhimagga as 
          '<i>dukkhapanayanakarappavattilakkhana</i>, i.e. having the characteristic 
          of removing suffering or misery.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If anybody is, or 
          a good many other people are found or seen to be suffering and in misery, 
          a noble-minded person will feel like removing this suffering or miserable 
          condition. This is nothing but a feeling of compassion and goodwill. 
          Hence, <i>paradukkho sati</i> - if any other person is suffering, nay, 
          if anybody is seen or heard to be in distress or in suffering, <i>sadhanam</i> 
          - men of virtue, <i>hadayakampanam</i> - moved with self-giving compassion, 
          or the heart palpitates, <i>karotiti </i>- makes the hearts of virtuous 
          men moved with compassion, (and therefore) <i>karuna</i> - is called 
          <i>karuna, vacanattha</i> - and expressed or stated authoritatively 
          as such.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To put it in another 
          way, <i>paradukkham</i> - regarding another's suffering, <i>kinatihim 
          sati vinasetiti</i> - being likely to remove, or rather, eager to remove, 
          it is known as '<i>karuna</i>'. Since it is stated as being "eager 
          to remove" another's suffering, a question may arise as to whether 
          it would really remove or wipe out the suffering. A person who feels 
          pity having had deep sympathy for another in trouble, may save the other 
          by exercising his faculty of <i>karuna</i> or compassion. There are 
          clear instances where suffering is removed or cured as also where no 
          assistance to rescue can be rendered. Though suffering cannot be subdued, 
          a person who has the compassionate feeling will still feel like removing 
          the suffering. In any case, one would feel sorry for another's plight, 
          or feel like dispelling the distress or misery suffered by another. 
          When a person stricken with disease is found, a feeling of compassion 
          or pity will arise automatically wishing the other to get immediate 
          relief, or if possible, get cured. Much as he may wish, if he is not 
          competent to give medical treatment, he cannot effectively assist the 
          other. And yet, he is at heart willing to see him recovered from illness 
          or suffering. Such being the case, this instinctive nature of a man 
          wishing to remove or cure another's suffering, should be regarded as 
          "<i>karuna</i>".<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In other words, 
          <i>kam sukham </i>- one's own happiness, <i>rundhatiti</i> - is likely 
          to be prevented or hindered, and hence, <i>karuna</i> - it is known 
          as '<i>karuna</i>'. <i>Karuna</i> is said to have the basic quality 
          of preventing one's own happiness from occurring, or rather, deterring 
          one's self-realization of happiness. A person who is compassionate will 
          lose his opportunity to some extent to make himself happy since he has 
          to be rendering help to another so as to let the other escape from trouble 
          or misery. If one is found to be suffering in his close proximity or 
          under his own eyes, he is ready to offer his aid. During this interregnum, 
          he will not have an opportunity to seek for his own happiness. He may 
          even lose his sleep during nighttime for having had to render his assistance 
          and look after the welfare of another person. He may have to forego 
          his sleep and sacrifice his own happiness. If a sick person is found, 
          he has got to nurse him as far as possible, and by doing so, he may 
          himself suffer stiffness in his own limbs or get tired. Sometimes, he 
          may even fall sick. At one time, a medical doctor was said to have suffered 
          from gastric ulcer for being fully preoccupied in attending the sick 
          which had caused him to miss his regular meals. He died of that stomach 
          disease while still young. Hence, karuna or compassion can prevent one's 
          own happiness.</font></p>

          offered his own body to serve as a platform (a bridge) on the path which 
          was then under repairs, to be trod upon by Dipankara Buddha who was 
          about to come along that roadway. At that time, if he had practised 
          the noble Dhamma after assuming the role of a Bhikkhu, he would have 
          become an Arahat and then entered Parinibbana in that very life. He 
          too realised and believed as such because he was then an extraordinary 
          person accomplished with <i>jhana-abhinna, </i>supernatural knowledge 
          or faculty. A person who has attained <i>jhana </i>can become an Arahat

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However,

          the Perfection which could lead to becoming a Buddha by practising virtues 
          in the most perfect manner. During these countless existences, he had 
          undergone the severest sufferings and privations and had come across 
          old age, sickness and death repeatedly. In one of his last ten existences 
          as King Vesantara, he was banished to a forest as the people of his 
          country were discontented with the way he practised charity in giving 
          away the White Elephant which was in those days regarded as one of the 
          most sacred treasures of the State. While remaining in the forest in 
          exile, a Brahmin by the name of Jukaka appeared and asked him to give 
          away his young son and daughter in charity for the purpose of employing 
          them as servants. It was really heart-rending and yet, he had nobly 
          offered his innocent little son Jali and daughter Kanhajina despite 
          his mental distress to the extent of shedding tears in sorrow to gain 
          his vowed Perfection. Just imagine how he would suffer mentally. To 
          achieve those difficult Perfection <i>(Paramitas), </i>he had gone through 
          great misery and sorrow.</font></p>

          <i>(lobha), </i>anger <i>(dosa) </i>and delusion <i>(moha). </i>For 
          such demerits, he had his rounds of existences many a time as animals, 
          and thereby suffered pain and misery. Moreover, mention was made in 
          "Temiya" Jataka that he had even gone through the Hell for ill-treating 
          a person in one of his existences as a King in which capacity he had 
          passed a judgement imposing a cruel penalty.</font></p>

          having opportunity to gain happiness for, being deterred by his unparalleled 
          <i>Karuna</i>.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          <i>Karuna </i>is<i> </i>extremely noble and gentle. It is usual for 
          a virtuous man to have compassion and sympathy for a person who is in 
          trouble. On the other hand, he who has no feeling of sympathy towards 
          others in dire distress is not a man of virtue but of vice. That is 
          why this <i>karuna dhamma - "sevitabba, bhavittabba dhamma " - </i>ought<i>
</i>to be resorted to, developed and depended upon by each and everybody 
          who is noble. Ordinarily, even without practising <i>bhavana, </i>one 
          should have a feeling of sympathy towards a pitiable person, if seen 
          or found. Every time feeling of compassion arises, it would amount to 
          developing merits.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
          desirous of developing through <i>bhavana, </i>the method to be applied 
          is similar to that of developing <i>metta bhavana. </i>It should not 
          be developed beginning from those who are near and dear to one who is 
          developing, at the initial stage. Neither should it be developed starting 
          from the most beloved person. Nor should it be developed beginning from 
          a neutral person or from a person who is hostile, or rather, an enemy. 
          It is because one who is dear to you will remain as a dear and affectionate 
          person, and hence, no compassion is called for. Similarly, the most 
          beloved person, etc., will continue to remain as the most beloved ones 
          and so on. As a matter of fact no feeling of compassion needs be invoked. 
          In the case of a person of opposite sex, since lust is likely to occur, 
          one should avoid developing <i>karuna </i>towards him or her at the 
          very initial stage. Also in respect of a person who is dead and gone, 
          no <i>karuna </i>should be developed as it is uncalled for. Such being 
          the case, the question arises as to who, should be the first towards 
          whom <i>karuna is </i>to be developed. It may be explained as follows:</font></p>

</i>spreads out his compassion. It has been mentioned as such in Abhidhamma 
          Vibhanga Pali. According to this Pali, explanation has been given in 
          the Commentary that <i>karuna </i>should be developed and radiated first 
          and foremost towards a very pitiable person <i>who is in </i>great distress.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Karuna 
          </i>should be developed initially towards individuals who are in extreme 
          distress, such as, a person who is in great trouble, or a destitute 
          with no friends and relatives to be relied upon, or a disease-stricken 
          person who is groaning with pain for not receiving the aid of a medical 
          doctor and for lack of medicine, or a detestable person afflicted with 
          leprosy so loathsome that nobody would like to touch him. Feeling of 
          compassion will easily arise if such a person in distress is seen. For 
          that reason, instruction is given to start developing <i>karuna, </i>beginning 
          from a poor pitiable person.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If 
          such a person who deserves compassion is not found or seen, <i>karuna 
          </i>should be developed towards a happy-go-lucky person who is committing 
          evil deeds by comparing him with a man awaiting orders to be hanged, 
          or rather, an imminent death after receiving capital punishment. The 
          manner of comparison made therein is as follows:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
          ancient times, the man on whom death sentence was passed, was tied up 
          with ropes and exhibited to the<i> </i>people while in custody by letting 
          him go on foot under escort along the road in the city to the place 
          where execution was to be done. At every junction of the road, the poor 
          criminal was made to stop for awhile and cruelly whipped more than a 
          hundred times. The man in custody with death hanging over his head was 
          generally offered with good and delicious food, etc., by some kind-hearted 
          people who pitied the fate of that condemned man. 'faking this opportunity 
          which came in his way for a moment, the guilty man enjoyed the food, 
          etc. The majority of the spectators, however, did not think of him As 
          being happy. They had compassion on him knowing fully well that every 
          step he took brought him- closer to death. In much the same way, a person 
          who is developing <i>karuna, </i>though he may see a happy spectacle 
          can develop <i>karuna </i>towards another people who is full of vice. 
          It has been stated that he should develop imagining that the scoundrel 
          may be happy now but that misery will befall him in the near future 
          as he is going to descend to the Nether Worlds for his demerits, after 
          demise.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At 
          the present time, it is not uncommon to find people who are deserving 
          of compassion, such as a person who is in distress for being cruelly 
          ill-treated by the other, or a person who is afflicted with serious 
          disease, or a person who is leading a miserable life for being in financial 
          straits. In fact, such cases are generally found rampant. It is. therefore 
          required to develop <i>karuna </i>towards such pitiable persons.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          is only one mode of developing <i>karuna, </i>unlike developing <i>metta 
          </i>which involves many kinds. It is stated as: '"<i>dukkha muccantu", 
          </i>i.e. 'May escape from misery'. This is the way how to develop <i>karuna 
          </i>to all beings - s<i>abbe satta. </i>However, if <i>karuna is </i>developed 
          towards a certain person, the name should be said and <i>karuna</i> 
          radiated as: "May (so and so) be free or liberated from misery."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i> </i>This 
          misery which should be liberated is one which is occurring in the corporeality 
          of a particular individual right at the moment. It is to develop continuously 
          and earnestly from the bottom of his heart that such and such a person 
          be free or liberated from misery or suffering,</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          manner of developing just described can be adopted in the case of developing 
          <i>karuna </i>towards a person who may be suffering misery caused by 
          illness, or by severe weather condition, or by maltreatment, or by discontentment. 
          Even if no misery is prevailing at the, present moment, that person 
          will have the inevitable suffering of his life existence <i>(vatta). 
          </i>Development of <i>karuna </i>can be resorted to wishing him to be 
          liberated from such suffering or misery.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          feeling of <i>karuna - compassion - is </i>occurring, visualising the 
          person in distress, an "enemy" from near and afar (remote), may appear. 
          If he still has his grievance against another person, unpleasant thoughts 
          or feeling of animosity may occur. This is the "enemy" who is said to 
          be near. Thought may arise to make a reprisal against a person who has 
          ill-treated you. For example, if a dog is found bullying and biting 
          the other dog, one may feel like beating the dog that bullies through 
          compassion towards the other dog which is subjected to attack.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Another instance 
          may be cited thus: If a snake snatches and snaps a frog with its teeth, 
          the frog utters a pitiable sound in fright and pain. The man who sees 
          this unpleasant sight and hears the sound has his sympathy for the frog, 
          wishing the poor creature to escape from being bitten and swallowed. 
          This feeling <i>is "karuna" </i>Thereafter<i>, </i>a thought may arise 
          wishing to hit the snake in favour of the pitiable frog. This is "anger" 
          called <i>vihimsa </i>which, occurs after <i>karuna, </i>wishing to 
          hurt the snake. It is the remote "enemy". It will therefore be necessary 
          to remove or get rid of the two enemies - near and remote, and only 
          to develop purely compassion.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next, 
          it is also essential for one who is developing <i>karuna </i>to render 
          assistance to the person in distress both physically and verbally to 
          the best of his ability. This is for the sake of the person in distress 
          to get relief. If physical assistance is offered it amounts to <i>karuna-kayakamma. 
          </i>If help is given verbally, it is <i>karuna-vacikamma. </i>If both 
          physical and verbal assistance cannot be rendered, <i>karuna </i>will 
          have to be developed merely by way of radiating Compassion <i>- karuna 
          </i>An instance may be cited. No matter how one may have his great compassion 
          on cattle, goats, pigs, fowls and ducks which are about to be slaughtered 
          at the slaughterhouse or elsewhere, one cannot lend his assistance to 
          save the poor creatures; one who has witnessed this plight, can offer 
          have compassion, and nothing else could be done. It is purely <i>manokamma. 
          </i>If feeling of <i>karuna </i>as: "May. . . be free from suffering" 
          is radiated, it brings merit. If he has his Special Perfection <i>(paramitas), 
          </i>he can even achieve <i>karuna-jhana </i>while developing <i>karuna.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	To develop <i>karuna 
          is </i>not as easy as developing <i>metta. </i>It is because <i>metta 
          </i>can be developed with one's innermost</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">feeling of loving-kindness 
          and imparted to any other person as "May he be happy". As regards <i>karuna, 
          </i>it will be plausible to radiate one's feeling of compassion only 
          to a person who deserves compassion. It is not easy to develop mindfulness 
          on <i>karuna </i>towards a person who is in a happy mood. Nor is it 
          easy to inculcate the spirit of compassion in favour of a person in 
          a practical way effectively. In any case, we shall now develop <i>karuna 
          </i>towards all beings as laid down in the Pali Texts. Among these beings 
          there are many who are in distress and really pitiable.</font></p>

          pigs, fowls, birds and so on, are also in a state of suffering. Among 
          human beings, some are subjected' to persistent ill-treatment by those' 
          who have the upper hand. Some are afflicted with various kinds of diseases, 
          while some are undergoing hardships and are in a miserable state. Some 
          are physically and mentally distressed being at loggerheads with, one 
          another among themselves, whereas some are greatly depressed because 
          of dotage, sickness and death. Some are bereaved and lamenting due to 
          loss of their dear and beloved ones. Some are in trouble for having 
          lost their business deals, or for destruction of their wealth or property. 
          Some are ridden with grief for being separated from their loved ones. 
          Among Devas also, some are in misery because of their insatiable desires. 
          On the eve of their death when ill omens of their next existence come 
          into vision, they become extremely dejected. We shall therefore bring

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What 
          has now been recited are 120 kinds of <i>dhisaodhisa karuna.</i> If 
          it is added to 12 kinds of <i>dhisa-anodhisa, </i>it will come to a 
          total of 132 kinds <i>of karuna-. </i>The manner of developing <i>karuna 
          </i>has now been fully described. It is, however, rather important to 
          inculcate a spirit of real compassionate feeling at the time <i>karuna 
          </i>is to be developed. <i>Karuna will only </i>be effective and genuine 
          if there is real compassion by visualising the miserable conditions 
          under which the beings are suffering. In this regard, if one imagines 
          the way Buddha had radiated His Compassion with His faculty of Great 
          Compassion <i>(Mahakaruna), </i>it will become obvious to a certain 
          extent how pitiable are those beings. I will, therefore give an illustration 
          with relevant extracts from Patisambhida-Magga Pali as to how <i>Mahakaruna 
          </i>knowledge has occurred. These are worthy of reverence, and will 
          give you a clear vision of the pitiable state of all beings. Anyhow, 
          only a few extracts will have to be explained for want of time.</font></p>

          <i>katamam - </i>is what?</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Buddha's knowledge 
          or Wisdom which cannot be achieved by his disciples comprises six kinds. 
          These are (1) <i>Indriyaparopartyatta-nana - </i>which knows the maturity 
          or otherwise, i.e.' the depth of the faculty or 'sense of knowledge', 
          of the living beings; (2) <i>Asayanusaya-nana - which </i>knows the 
          Anusayas or inclinations relating to the seat of mental disposition 
          and <i>kilesa </i>that may arise of the living beings; (3) <i>Yamakapatihariya-nana 
          - which </i>knows the faculty or power to create a double miracle, or 
          rather, a miracle in pairs; (4) <i>Mahakarunasamapatti-nana </i>- knowledge 
          or endowments of Great Compassion induced by ecstatic meditation; (5). 
          <i>Subbannuta-nana - </i>attainment of omniscience: All Knowing Wisdom; 
          (6) <i>Anavarana-nana - </i>faculty which dispels all obstructions or 
          hindrances in the way of such knowledge. These knowledge being out of 
          reach of or unconcerned with the Disciples, are also called <i>Asadharana-nana 
          </i>i.e. knowledge which is peculiar or unrivalled. The question raised 
          was: "What is <i>Mahakarunasamappatti-nana </i>from among the said six 
          kinds?" The answer given in continuation was as mentioned below:</font></p>

            sattesu mahakaruna okkamati."</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The above Pali phrase 
          conveys the meaning that great compassion for mortals or beings enters 
          the hearts of the Enlightened Buddhas who see various conditions under<b>
</b>different circumstances to which beings are subjected.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Feeling of Great 
          Compassion occurs in the minds of Omniscient Buddhas seeing numerous 
          kinds of sufferings prevailing among all beings. Most living beings 
          do not perceive other beings' miserable conditions. They might see only 
          creatures or living beings who are in great distress and suffering. 
          When fairly happy persons see others who are in the same boat, they 
          think of them or imagine them as being happy as they are. Relating to 
          people who are found to be happier than they are, they might look up 
          on them as living in a state of extreme happiness without any misery, 
          and consider them as not 'deserving of compassion. This indicates dearth 
          of compassionate feeling for not actually knowing the state of misery. 
          The Buddhas, however, clearly perceived the various kinds of circumstances 
          under which beings are suffering. Seeing the sentient beings in such 
          miserable conditions, Great Compassion has entered the hearts of the 
          Buddhas. How <i>karuna </i>occurs will be stated in amplification as 
          follows:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All beings have 
          to be always exerting themselves and constantly worrying. Seeing living 
          beings in such a miserable state fiercely struggling for their own survival, 
          Buddha's hearts go out to them with Great Compassion.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What is to be realised 
          is that mankind are constantly striving and worrying for their own livelihood 
          or subsistence. Ordinary worldlings may not think it as being pitiable. 
          They may consider this state of condition as being normal. They generally 
          imagine that as a man, one will have to strive or sweat for his own 
          living and that it is quite natural. Some may argue that there is no 
          need to grumble. However, from the point of view of the Buddha, the 
          Enlightened One, these beings are perceived as toiling, struggling and 
          constantly worrying for one's own burden of <i>khandha</i>, and are 
          therefore in misery, nay, they are found to be in great distress. In 
          any kind of existence wherever they are born, they have to be worrying 
          without any interval in their lifetime carrying this heavy load of khandha. 
          In the life existence of a human being, as a small child, one has to 
          depend upon the parents and others. He cannot stand on his own. From 
          the age of about four, five or six years and onwards, he has to attend 
          school for his education. Since about the age of eighteen or twenty 
          or so, he has to perform various kinds of work and bear the workload 
          under the given circumstances for his own subsistence or to satisfy 
          his needs. If fortune fails to smile on him, he will face a lot of trouble 
          to make ends meet with his income. Impairment of his health will bring 
          misery and suffering. Sometimes, he may come across pitfalls in the 
          path of his life and meet with dangers, and if so happen, misery will 
          befall him. Throughout his life existence, he is living in anxiety and 
          is struggling continuously. While thus indulging himself enmeshed in 
          trouble and misery, time comes when he grows old, suffers sickness and 
          eventually meets his death. Some even die while labouring and working 
          with all their might. It implies the growth, change and decay of the 
          physical man in the course of his human existence, in which he suffers 
          constant misery.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the life existence 
          as animals, from the time of birth, the majority have to find food for 
          their survival. Among animals living in places where food and water 
          are scarce, they have to undergo great hardships in finding food and 
          shelter. Animals in the forests have no protection at all. They have 
          to be worrying for their preservation and for the upkeep of their <i>khandhas</i> 
          intact, with constant fear of danger and death. Some of the animals 
          have to search for food only at night - being afraid of going out in 
          the daytime. In hell and in the world of Petas, <i>apaya</i> beings 
          are in constant misery and suffering. They cannot, of course, be seen 
          by human naked eyes. Even among 'nats' (Devas), there are demons, goblins 
          or spirits called 'Yakkha' who are in a state of misery nearly as bad 
          as Petas, Vinipatika, i.e. those beings of lowly existence have a very 
          hard life under worse conditions to the point of near starvation. They 
          too are in great misery. Those Devas in the higher abodes - up in the 
          heaven, are, of course, in a state of happiness. However, when their 
          life span expires, those whose <i>kusala-kamma</i> are lacking in strength, 
          become miserable.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As such, all beings 
          are living in misery and are striving with endless worry to keep their 
          existing <i>khandha</i> (body) in good trim to gain happiness, and at 
          the same time, to get a new set of <i>khandhas</i> with happiness in 
          the future existences to come. Though people are said to be living under 
          favourable circumstances and are in a state of happiness, they have 
          to be always worrying in order to maintain themselves in good shape 
          at present and also to achieve future benefits in their next existences. 
          They want to enjoy life with happiness in future existences as well 
          and, hence, in the present lifetime, they are trying to accumulate merits. 
          Of course, to achieve happiness in future existences one has to struggle 
          with constant worry and anxiety according to one's own conviction in 
          the religious doctrine which he has accepted as true. Whether it is 
          proper or not, one is trying hard for the welfare of his future, relying 
          on his own faith and conviction. Those who do not believe in the doctrine 
          of existences to come, i.e. the religious view of complete annihilation 
          in this very life existence, are nonetheless striving with all heart 
          and soul to be able to enjoy a most happy and pleasurable life in this 
          present existence.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Great was Buddha's 
          Compassion for all beings, having himself seen and found them always 
          suffering with worry in their persistent effort hoping to gain happiness 
          in every life existence, while at the same time they are burdened with 
          their <i>khandhas</i>. Buddha realised that there was no other Saviour 
          except Him to lead them to Nibbana - at which stage all <i>khandhas</i> 
          would cease to exist. Realising as such, with his deep Compassion and 
          goodwill, the Buddha had travelled far and wide during his lifetime 
          and had imparted his noble teachings. He tackled all questions put to 
          him by humans and Devas on points relating to Dhamma. He had hardly 
          any rest throughout day and night except a brief respite of three or 
          four hours. He had to deliver his preachings daily for about 20 hours 
          to Devas, humans and Brahmas. This lends evidence to the fact that his 
          own Great Compassion had prevented his happiness, as stated earlier. 
          So great was his unbounded compassion that the benevolent Buddha had 
          gone to the extent of imparting his Dhamma to Subhadda, a wandering 
          ascetic (<i>paribbajako</i>), while lying on his death-bed a few hours 
          before his Parinibbana. To that extent, he has bestowed his unstinted 
          love with self-sacrificing pity on all beings seeing their miserable 
          plight.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The gist of the 
          foregoing account is to make it clear that Buddha had his Great Compassion 
          on all beings who are struggling with worry in every life existence. 
          This will perhaps enable you to grasp the fact that one can develop 
          his <i>karuna</i> towards pitiable beings who are going through a lot 
          of difficulties and misery throughout their life span. This will also 
          place you in a nobler state of mind which would invoke a feeling of 
          reverence to the Most Exalted One who had painstakingly preached, proclaiming 
          his message for forty odd years with unfailing patience, sympathy and 
          goodwill for the welfare of all mankind.<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Hence, with a view 
          to developing <i>karuna</i> in the light of what has been now stated, 
          please follow the recitation.<br/>
</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all 
            beings who have always been striving with worry to gain happiness, 
            be liberated from misery."<font size="1"> (Repeat three times)</font></font>
</p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Full liberation 
          from this misery will be rewarded only when Nibbana is reached whereby 
          all <i>rupa-nama-khandhas</i> will cease to occur again. This means 
          to say that "May all beings be emancipated after attainment of 
          Nibbana."<br/>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us repeat developing

          for mortals arises in the Lord Buddha.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In every existence, all living beings are 
          carried away to reach old age from the time of their birth, and from 
          old age to sickness and then, from sickness to death. Buddha, perceiving 
          with his insight-knowledge the nature of "impermanence", has great compassion 
          on all beings. Of course, insofar as beings are concerned, if they reflect, 
          they will have an inkling of the impermanent nature of their own <i>khandhas. 
          </i>However, they may still think that they will have to live long, 
          apparently assuming that no deterioration is taking place in their youthful 
          appearance and in their health. While imagining as such, unexpectedly, 
          sickness may prevail on them under unfavourable circumstances. Some 
          died at an early age while still young. If death does not occur early, 
          they gradually grow older and older day' by day, month by month, and 
          year by year. Yet, inadvertently at first sight, they do not think of 
          themselves as getting old with the passage of time. Only when their 
          hair turned grey and their teeth decayed, etc., they would come to realise 
          that they have become old and decrepit. Who are those carrying them 
          away to inevitable old age, sickness and death? It is the <i>rupanama-khandhas 
          </i>in one's own material body who are conveying them, as stated already. 
          From the time of conception, new <i>rupas </i>and namas are incessantly 
          forming or arising and dissolving and then appearing afresh to be again 
          dissolved undergoing a gradual process of continual change. A person 
          slowly and perhaps unnoticeably grows older in every split second and 
          a fraction of a minute, etc., until when becoming advanced in age, say 
          about forty, the bodily appearance becomes obviously changed showing 
          signs of deterioration or decay with the appearance of grey hairs, wrinkles, 
          etc. Withering with age, one can easily be afflicted with a disease 
          at one time or other, and after serious derangement of his health, he 
          reaches his deathbed and ultimately passes away. It, therefore, becomes 
          evident that hour by hour, as time goes on, one is carried closer to 
          old age, sickness and death.</font></p>

          when I was a novice monk</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">An example may be 
          illustrated. A group of cattle slaughterers carried away an ox to be 
          killed. Every step taken by that ox brought him nearer to the threshold 
          of death. It seemed that the ox knew of the coming disaster - an imminent 
          death, and as such, it was found struggling to escape from the hands 
          of the butchers. The cattle slaughterers were, however, seen pulling 
          it hard and dragging the poor animal with force. The ox had no way out 
          but to submit to this ill treatment against its own will. It was indeed 
          a pitiable sight. As I had personally seen this heartbreaking spectacle, 
          I felt pain in my heart with compassion, and since then, I have abstained 
          from taking beef. This incident had happened when I was a Samanera, 
          a novice in my monkhood before I received my higher ordination as a 
          senior Bhikkhu. Just like that ox which was carried away by the slaughterers 
          to the slaughter-house, human beings are being carried away by their 
          <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas </i>without any break, even for a second, 
          to make them suffer from old age, sickness and death. Having seen all 
          beings drifting towards disaster great compassion had arisen in him.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What the Lord Buddha 
          had perceived was that one is fast approaching old age, sickness and 
          death at every moment of an arising though which occurs incessantly 
          with great acceleration much faster than a split second, nay, a flash 
          of lightning. This perception brought forth a feeling of boundless compassion 
          in the Lord Buddha. Even Yogis who are now contemplating Vipassana can 
          fully appreciate that they are gradually approaching old age, sickness 
          and death at every moment, if they perceived the mind that constantly 
          changes. Those Yogis who are contemplating and noting as instructed 
          by us on reaching the stage of <i>bhanga-nana </i>will find it very 
          obvious that the object of sensation that is noted and the knowing mind 
          dissolve part by part incessantly. It is something like each bead threaded 
          with others on the string falling down one after the other in great 
          speed. Every time dissolution takes place, it carries one nearer to 
          old age, sickness and death. Yogis who have achieved <i>bhanga-nana 
          </i>may, guess with their insight-knowledge that it is so happening.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ordinary persons 
          can imagine this state of phenomena within a second, or a minute, or 
          an hour, or a day, or a month, or a year. Roughly speaking, one will 
          clearly perceive himself as coming a bit closer to old age, sickness 
          and death if he could reflect upon his own self year to year. Signs 
          of withering in age followed by sickness and death can be visualised. 
          Generally most people die when they reach the age of seventy or eighty 
          plus. Both the rich and the poor, as well as dictators, powerful rulers 
          and heroes come to a road-end in the path of life, i.e. Death, between 
          the age of 70 or 80 or a little beyond that age. Rupas and <i>namas 
          </i>in one's own body are carrying him away to old age, sickness and 
          death. Let us recite a motto composed in this regard.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Oh! Men are impermanent, 
            being driven to old age, sickness and death."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If this motto is 
          reflected upon, the nature of <i>anicca </i>becomes obvious. <i>Marananussati</i> 
          i.e. mindfulness contemplation on, the nature of death will also become 
          developed. In every existence, all beings have to go through the process 
          of inevitable, old age, sickness and death. This is the rugged and dangerous 
          path they are treading along. How pitiable they are. One can very well 
          imagine this awful state. It is not surprising that Great Compassion 
          had arisen in Buddha towards beings. Let's develop <i>karuna </i>as 
          Buddha Himself had done. Please follow the recitation.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Oh! All beings 
            are subjected to old age, sickness and death to which they are being 
            conveyed. That's really Impermanent!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all beings 
            be liberated from this misery." </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">(Repeat)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The manner of developing 
          <i>karuna </i>as stated above, is of a very high standard. It is similar 
          to the great compassion bestowed upon mankind by the Lord Buddha. Among 
          people in general, a great many of them are in misery for having suffered 
          loss in their business venture or for loss or destruction of their property, 
          or for being separated from their beloved ones. Karuna can be developed 
          towards such people in misery. Please recite as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"May all beings 
            who are suffering misery in one way or the other, be liberated from 
            such misery."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	It means that 
          all living beings have no one to protect or look after them and no one 
          to rely upon. Korabya King not being able to grasp the meaning of this 
          statement had once asked Ashin Ratthapala: "0, Ashin Ratthapala! We 
          have many armed forces to defend and protect us. They are to be relied 
          upon. What is then the, intention conveyed I the statement, 'Have no 
          one to protect and rely upon?" Thereupon, Ashin Ratthapala queried, 
          "O, Your Majesty Korabya! Don't you ever have any affliction? If that 
          afflicted disease ill-treats you cruelly, how would you feel?" To this 
          query, King Korabya replied: "When this disease becomes very serious 
          and ill-treats me, I will suffer gravely to the point of near death. 
          There had been occasions when my relatives in close proximity of my 
          sick-bed wept bitterly, even shedding tears thinking that I was about 
          to die."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Having heard this 
          reply, for the purpose of verification, another question put was: "0, 
          King Korabya! When this disease had caused you terrible pain and suffering, 
          could you share it with your relative's and friends? Will you be able 
          to share the suffering if you ask them to give you relief. To this, 
          King Korabya gave his reply, "Sir, it's impossible to share it. Neither 
          can they take a share in it. I alone have to suffer severely and endure 
          the pain with all the ill-power at my command." Ashin Ratthapala then 
          explained saying, "Aye! Exactly, Your Majesty, Buddha has therefore 
          preached that just as there is no one who can give protection and on 
          whom reliance can be made in times of extreme distress such as this, 
          living beings also have no one to protect them and in whom refuge can 
          be sought.",</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the presence 
          of parents and relatives who are rendering utmost assistance and giving 
          full protection, they cannot possibly prevent their dear ones from getting 
          old, sick and suffering death. No one is capable of looking, after another 
          to keep him always young and vigorous. When the time comes, one is sure 
          to get old. This nature of old age cannot be shared. In case, it can 
          be shared, by distributing part and parcel of it to others, one would 
          have become always youthful and sprightly. If it can be done that way, 
          how fine it would be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Though preventive 
          measures in regard to health can be taken by appropriate drugs and medicines, 
          total prevention against diseases is impossible. If really serious or 
          malignant disease is afflicted, no perfect cure can be done. Suffering 
          from disease can neither be shared in piecemeal. If it is within the 
          bounds of possibility to share, the sufferings, how nice it would be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No one can possibly 
          prevent death. Old age, sickness and death cannot be prevented by anyone. 
          No one can also prevent a person from descending to the Four Nether 
          Worlds to which he is destined after his demise. Realising this fate 
          of all living<i> </i>beings, Buddha had bestowed his immense compassion 
          on them. Let us recite a motto in the light of what has just been stated:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Without a protector 
            and without anything to rely upon, how feeble and weary we are."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the entire Universe, 
          no one will be found who can save a person to get liberated from the 
          sufferings of old age, sickness and death, or to escape from descending 
          to the Nether World, or to get emancipated from the miseries of <i>Samsara. 
          </i>According to the Doctrine of the creator of mankind, God is said 
          to be able to save mankind. Nevertheless, adherent to this Doctrine 
          will also, in the course of time, become old, sick and meet with death 
          like any other beings. On the other hand, the manner in which Buddha 
          saves all mankind is by way of preaching - laying down the method of 
          practice to get liberated from the world of sufferings and miseries. 
          It is something like prescribing and administering medicines by a physician 
          to a patient under treatment. Just as the sick who complies with the 
          advice and instructions given by the doctor, has recovered from sickness, 
          a person who obeys and complies with the instruction of the Lord Buddha 
          and practises according to his teachings, will be liberated from the 
          miseries of <i>Apaya </i>and <i>Samsara. </i>The meaning of this statement 
          as preached by the Buddha is as mentioned below.</font></p>

          according to His Teachings (<i>desana</i>), there will be no escape. 
          The Right Method can only be known and heard only when Buddhas appear 
          in this Universe. Outside the realm of Buddha's Sasana, there can be 
          no emancipation from miseries since no right method is known and understood 
          to be practised. In the absence of the right method of exercise, and 
          inasmuch as there is no one on whom reliance can be made, beings are 
          whirling round and round in Samsara, i.e. floating and drifting in the 
          whirlpool of endless existences, and are therefore, suffering in misery. 
          This state of pitiable condition being seen and observed by the Lord 
          Buddha, the flame of compassion for all beings had awakened in him. 
          Just as Buddha had his compassion, we shall dwell our mind on all beings

          own status. For so long as destruction or loss has not yet been met

          overcome good health. Youthfulness ends in old age, or in other words, 
          sound and vigorous body grows old in the end. Though a person is fully 
          accomplished with wealth, honour or fame, nothing can be taken along 
          with him on his death. Even endowment with a large number of retinue

          Story of King Siridhammasoka</b></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">About 
          218 years after the Parinibbana of the Lord Buddha (about 270 BC), there 
          came to the throne of India, a famous King by the name of Asoka. It 
          was stated that his fame and glory had spread all over the Continent 
          of India (Jambudipa) which was founded by him as an Empire. According 
          to what is contained in the rocks and stone pillars on which his edicts 
          were carved and where writings were inscribed as directed by this great 
          monarch, the country then called 'Jambudipa' is to be understood as 
          the Indian Continent as is known today. It is because in these rock 
          and pillar inscriptions, mention had been made of the places at the 
          periphery of his vast Empire where his dynamic power was felt. In those 
          days, it was considered to be a vast domain. He was one of the greatest 
          of India's kings. According to the Commentaries, Asoka was said to be 
          a powerful sovereign of a large empire, its area stretching even up 
          to one <i>Yojana </i>right up to the sky above. Although he was a benevolent 
          dictator and an Emperor with absolute powers possessing immense treasures, 
          at the time of his approaching death, only a remnant of his vast dominion 
          remained under his sway and it was stated to have been reduced to an 
          area equal to about half of the size of a white plum fruit. So says 
          the Visuddhimagga as mentioned below.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>"Sakalam medinim 
            bhutva,<br/>
            datva kotisatam sukhi.<br/>
            Addamalakamattassa,<br/>
            ante issaratam gato.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Sukhi</i> - 
          Extremely rich and well-endowed with prosperity and immense wealth, 
          Asoka - a king by the name of <i>Asoka, sakalam medinim -</i> the entire 
          earth surface of Jambudipa, <i>bhutva </i>- having ruled and owned, 
          <i>kotisatam datva - and </i>after giving away in charity numerous properties 
          and all his wealth worth billions, <i>ante - </i>at<i> </i>last, <i>addamalakanattassa 
          - </i>only about half the size of a stony plum fruit, <i>issaratam </i>- 
          had remained in his dominion, <i>gato - </i>and had gone down, or rather, 
          lost his eminent position to that extent. The gist of it is that fabulously 
          rich and powerful King Asoka who had dominated over the whole continent 
          of India, after offering all his properties and wealth in his possession, 
          eventually had been reduced to the status of a sovereign with dominion 
          over only a patch of territory about the size of the diameter of the 
          round plum fruit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the earlier part 
          of his life, he was extolled as an extremely powerful monarch with sovereignty 
          over the entire length and breadth of India (Jambudipa). He had accumulated 
          riches and properties to such an extent that he offered in donation 
          ninety-six (96) crores of kyats in a single day. Eventually, however, 
          in the last days before his death,' his health had deteriorated. It 
          seemed that his Ministers, Generals, and other officers appeared to 
          treat him with scant respect. These facts were disclosed in what is 
          called the Text of <i>Dibyavadana. </i>A fairly comprehensive account 
          of it is described in the Burmese version of the Visuddhimagga. Now 
          I would have to give you only a brief account of it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the time when 
          the great King Asoka was on his sick-bed, he was served with food put 
          in a tray made of pure gold as usual. After taking his meals, the King 
          donated the gold trays, plates and cups to Kukkutarama monastery. Later, 
          he was served with silver plates. This silverware was also sent to the 
          Kukkutarama monastery to be given away in charity. These offerings of 
          gifts were stated to have been made to fulfil his main objective to 
          reach to the value of his gifts up to a total of one hundred crores, 
          as the total value of gifts was then short of four crores i.e. only 
          96 crores. Thereafter, his State Ministers were said to have served-the 
          food and meals for their King with only earthen pots. Thereupon, the 
          King was dismayed and alarmed since only half of the plum fruit which 
          was presented to him had reached his hands. He therefore ordered that 
          a meeting of State Ministers and courtiers be convened. At the convention, 
          King Asoka asked, "Who is ruling this country?" The Chief Minister replied, 
          "Your Majesty is the Sovereign who governs this country."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then, King Asoka 
          remarked, "What the Chief Minister has said falls short of the truth 
          now. Presently, I own and govern only half of this white plum fruit," 
          and proceeded to tell his Chief Minister that "All kinds of accomplishments 
          only end. in utter destruction," as preached by the Buddha is perfectly 
          true. If further amplification is desired to be known, reference may 
          be made to the Visuddhimagga, Volume II of the Burmese version (page 
          217 etc.). Hence, the statement that "beings have no personal property 
          of their own, and when death occurs, everything will have to be abandoned" 
          is really true, and accurate. All that have been considered as one's 
          own possessions with great attachment, had to be abandoned or left behind 
          at the time when death seizes. Even the corporeal body with all clothes, 
          etc., which is dressed up, will invariably have to be forsaken. Having 
          seen all beings in this pitiable plight, feelings of compassion had 
          arisen in the Buddha. Let us devote our mind to such beings, and develop 
          <i>karuna.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beings, seeking 
          worldly possessions as their own and keeping all these in their personal 
          custody though not actually belong to them are in misery both in body 
          and mind, and are therefore pitiable. Hence, all beings may be liberated 
          from such misery. The Motto is couched referring to this state of condition, 
          as:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"There is: "no 
            personal private property. Oh, all things have got to be abandoned 
            eventually!"</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The

          possess. This is also perfectly true and correct. One may try to possess 
          things which they are originally lacking, imagining at first that he 
          will remain contented with what is available sufficient enough or his 
          present needs to live on. However, when things are obtained as envisaged, 
          they may still crave for more. One who is earning a kyat will hope to 
          get two kyats, and one who gets two kyats, may desire to receive three 
          kyats, and so on. His thirst for getting more and more cannot be quenched. 
          That is the reason why multimillionaires at the present day are worrying 
          and making their efforts to get richer and richer. While thus, seeking 
          wealth with their insatiable desires or greed, they have to die without 
          contentment.</font></p>

          example, any amount of rainwater and waters from rivers -and rivulets 
          may flow into the vast expanse of the ocean, and yet the mighty ocean 
          never gets flooded. Another instance may be cited. Any amount of inflammable 
          material may be poured into a burning heap of fire and yet it will be 
          consumed in no time. Every time combustible material is put in, it ingurgitates 
          and burns all the more. Similarly, beings are never satiated. This greed 
          and discontentment is caused by the influence of <i>tanha. </i>As impulsed 
          by <i>tanha, </i>beings go on striving to earn for their living. Accordingly, 
          they have become slaves to <i>tanha. </i>Buddha, seeing these beings 
          who are ridden with <i>tanha </i>and are toiling for their livelihood, 
          had great compassion on them. It is just like a laborious servant sweating 
          in misery through fear to perform a task as ordered by his master.' 
          It is a pitiable sight as seen by a person who has sympathy towards 
          other fellow beings. The motto composed for the purpose may now be recited:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"Unfulfilled desires

</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Beings 
          who are not yet free from <i>tanha, </i>have become slaves, and have 
          to be doing things as dictated by <i>tanha. </i>Worldlings are compelled 
          to do the act of killing if ordered to do so by <i>tanha. </i>Those 
          who think they will prosper by resorting to killing, are committing 
          this heinous crime as prompted by <i>tanha, </i>King Ajatasatu of Magadha 
          assassinated his father Bimbisara because he was incited by <i>tanha 
          </i>which craved for the kingly pleasures of life. All those worldlings 
          not yet liberated from <i>tanha </i>for having committed <i>pancanantariyakammam, 
          </i>the five Sins that bring with them immediate retribution, are no 
          W suffering great misery in Hell or <i>Apaya, </i>etc. However, a Sotapanna 
          is free, from <i>tanha </i>that can drag him down to <i>Apaya. </i>Hence, 
          he will abstain from committing vices, such as, killing and stealing 
          'which can cause one to land in the nether world. Nevertheless, for 
          not being free from. <i>kamatanha, </i>passionate attachment, he is 
          still in trouble seeking for sensual pleasures as stimulated or urged 
          by <i>tanha. </i>A Sakadagami also is still doing things as provoked 
          by the subtle form of <i>kamatanha. </i>Even an Anagami, though he has 
          got rid of <i>kamatanha, </i>has to do things as forcibly urged by <i>rupa-tanha 
          </i>and <i>arupa-tanha. </i>However, he has no misery physically and 
          mentally because of that <i>tanha. </i>He has only <i>sankhara-dukkha.</i> 
          As for an Arahat, having totally eradicated all kinds of <i>tanha, </i>he 
          has been fully emancipated from the slavish bonds of <i>tanha. </i>Therefore, 
          Compassion which had arisen in Buddha was simply because He found and 
          realised that <i>Puthujjanasekkha </i>individuals who, for not having 
          been free from <i>tanha, </i>are undergoing great misery as slaves of 
          the <i>tanha. </i>Among them the most pitiable are the ordinary worldlings. 
          Taking cue from the manner in which Buddha had nurtured Compassion, 
          let us develop <i>karuna. </i>Please follow the recitation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"<i>Silla</i>" in 
          this regard refers to a stump or an arrow. It would be acceptable if 
          it were mentioned as a 'stump', i.e. a pointed stout piece of wood projected 
          from the ground. However, in the Commentary (Atthakatha), it has been 
          stated as 'arrow'. Hence, one may imagine as having had sympathy for 
          all beings who are pierced by arrows. Just as people are injured or 
          wounded by gunshots while fighting in a war, as in the present era, 
          the people in the ancient times who were hit by arrows during skirmishes, 
          also received injuries. Sentient beings face sufferings similar to those 
          who have suffered from pain caused by the piercing arrows. The kind 
          of arrows that has pierced is <i>akusala, </i>arrows of demerits, such 
          as <i>raga, dosa, moha, mina, Ditthi </i>and <i>kilesas, </i>which are 
          vices, the immoral conduct. If pierced through the body from the breast 
          to the backbone, it would be very distressing and painful. In the same 
          manner, beings are really pitiable for having been hit and pierced by 
          the seven arrows of <i>raga, dosa, </i>etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And yet, as ordinary 
          worldlings, they are rather pleased for being pierced by the arrows. 
          Sentient beings in the <i>Kana</i> - abode enjoying all the sensations 
          of sensual pleasures <i>(kamaguna) </i>have found a taste for <i>kamaraga. 
          </i>That is why they are nurturing and encouraging <i>kamavaga </i>and 
          are in hot pursuit of the sensations of sensual pleasures. From the 
          point of view of Buddhas and Arahats, they see and feel the arising 
          sensations of <i>kamaraga </i>as being unbearable just as if they are 
          pierced by arrows. <i>Raga </i>which tends to have pleasurable attachment 
          to <i>Rupa-bhava </i>(Form Existences) and <i>Arupa-bhava </i> (Formless 
          Existence) has the same nature of intolerance that can hardly be endured. 
          The manner of piercing by the arrow of anger is more conspicuous. From 
          a state of happiness which reflects on personal appearances, the complexion 
          of the face immediately turns black, ugly and gloomy when anger blazes 
          up. The mind also becomes morbid, restless and intolerable. However, 
          the man in an angry mood thinks of the rising -anger as pleasurable. 
          For this reason, if any other person with goodwill intervenes to bring 
          about a compromise and advises to refrain from anger and bearing grudge, 
          an angry person is likely to resent. He may even think of that mediator 
          as unfairly taking sides.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Moha </i>means 
          a mistaken or false view - not knowing what is right or true. What is 
          impermanent or transitory is thought of as permanent and everlasting. 
          All things which are incessantly arising and dissolving are considered 
          as pleasurable. The nature of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama</i> which is not 
          an <i>atta, </i>a living entity, is looked upon as a living entity, 
          a being, or 'Self'. If raga and <i>dosa </i>occur, <i>moha</i> follows 
          suit. Sentient beings pierced by arrows of <i>moha </i>(delusion) are 
          in misery. Under delusion, a person commits anything which is improper, 
          by physical action or by speech or by thought. Having done so, only 
          demerits are derived thereby causing miserable conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Also 
          because of the arrow or stump of mana, one meets with misery for his 
          unworthy self-pride or vanity, and because of the arrow of <i>Dittha 
          </i>which has pierced through the mental <i>khandha, </i>men cling to 
          false beliefs. They cannot discard or part with them. Falsely hoping 
          to gain benefits, what ought not to be done, is done physically, verbally 
          and mentally. Because of these vices, they all suffer misery. During 
          the lifetime of the Lord Buddha, Puranakassapa and a bunch of five other 
          teachers of a heretical Sect together with their adherents had unfortunately 
          accumulated a great deal of demerits for committing vices. They had 
          gone to the extent of doing wrong to the Buddha. For these vicious thoughts 
          and-evil actions (wrong doings), they had derived <i>akusala, </i>demerits, 
          in return. For these demerits, they were committed to Hell and had suffered 
          intense misery as a result. There are quite a number of people who are 
          suffering misery for being pierced by this arrow of <i>Dittha </i>or<i>
</i>false belief.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          are other sufferings for being pierced by the rest of the <i>kilesas, 
          </i>such as, <i>Vicikiccha, </i>sceptical doubts. <i>Vicikiccha </i>means 
          feeling of doubt as to whether the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha are really 
          the Truth. Uncertainty regarding the derivation of advantages in practising 
          <i>Sila</i>, <i>Samadhi </i>and <i>Vipassana, </i>or the attainment 
          of <i>jhana, </i>or the achievement. of Vipassana insight-knowledge, 
          or the realisation of Nibbana through <i>Magga-nana </i>and <i>phala-nana 
          </i>are also <i>"Vicikiccha". </i>Then, if any doubt arises as to whether 
          rebirth will really take place in existences under happy conditions 
          by virtue of <i>kusala-kamma, </i>or one has to suffer in the four nether 
          worlds for the resultant effects of his <i>akusala-kamma, </i>immoral 
          actions, it is <i>"vicikiccha". </i>For having been pierced by the arrow 
          of <i>Vicikiccha, </i>no practical meditation exercise can be done in 
          accordance with the correct method or on the right lines. Such being 
          the case, there will hardly be any chance to escape from the miseries 
          of Samsara which are bound to come across.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
          next, the piercing arrow of what is called '<i>duccarita' </i>- evil 
          deeds or misconduct - is conjoined with 'the arrows of <i>kilesas' </i>such 
          as <i>raga </i>and <i>dosa. </i>When <i>raga is </i>raging, evil deeds 
          of <i>duccarita-kamma, </i>such as, acts of killing, stealing, cheating, 
          etc., are sure to be committed. For such <i>akusala-kamma </i>or demeritorious' 
          (immoral) actions, one would descend to the four Apayas and suffer misery. 
          Undoubtedly, there are a number of people who will go down to the Four 
          <i>Apayas</i> or Nether Worlds, and who will thereby suffer miserable 
          conditions.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Compassion, therefore, 
          had arisen in the heart of Buddha for having seen those beings who were 
          pierced by arrows, such as, <i>raga</i>, etc. Being moved to compassion, 
          which had sprung from the heart, Buddha had delivered His Teachings 
          under varying circumstances for the entire period of 45 years, day and 
          night, without rest. Individuals who have diligently practised in accordance 
          with His Teachings, are, therefore, able to get rid of the piercing 
          arrows of <i>raga</i>, etc. If one arrow that has pierced through can 
          be extracted or removed, he gets better to the extent a single arrow 
          would have caused him hurt or pain. Accordingly, one who assiduously 
          practises Dhanna gradually gets rid of the arrows of kilesas one after 
          another until he is entirely relieved from all sufferings.</font></p>

        and noting the Dhamma</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At present, those Yogis who are continuously 
          contemplating and noting <i>rupas</i> and <i>namas </i>arising from 
          the six sense-doors, that is, contemplating what is going on in ones 
          mind and body, in accordance with the teachings on mindfulness meditation 
          (<i>Satipatthana</i>) are free from five <i>nivaranas, </i>obstacles 
          to the progress of meditation, when their mind becomes tranquil and 
          stabilised This is called <i>Citta Visuddhi</i>, purity of mind. With 
          the mind becoming tranquil and cleansed of the <i>nivaranas </i>at every 
          moment of contemplating and noting, it occurs to the mind of the mediator 
          with awareness that what is contemplated and known is quite different 
          from the mind that contemplates and knows, i.e., these two are distinguishably 
          known. When the rising movement of the abdomen is contemplated and known, 
          the rupa, that is the rising abdominal wall, and the mind - <i>nama</i> 
          that contemplates and knows, are distinguishably known. Similar knowledge 
          will be realised in contemplating the falling of the abdomen and the 
          acts of walking, stepping, dropping, bending and so on. Every time it 
          is so contemplated and noted, what is to be known and the knowing mind, 
          <i>rupa</i> and <i>nama</i> (matter and mind) are well appreciated as 
          the only two attributes of an individual representing material and mental 
          elements which form an aggregate of a sentient being. This appreciation 
          or the knowledge dispelling to a certain extent the arrow of <i>Ditthi 
          </i>is known as <i>ditthivisuddhi.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thereafter, if contemplation and noting 
          is carried on, cause and effect will be distinguishably known in that 
          because of mental inclination to bend, bending (which is<i> rupa</i>) 
          takes place. So also, because of the will to walk, the act of walking 
          (<i>rupa</i>) happens, and because of the object of sensation which 
          is to be known, the knowing-mind occurs, etc. At that moment, the piercing 
          arrow of doubt called <i>"kankha" </i>has been cleared away to a reasonable 
          extent. From then onwards, at every moment of contemplation and noting, 
          the beginning of the phenomenal occurrence and the final dissolution 
          of what has occurred will be clearly perceived and realised. The nature 
          of such arising and dissolution in respect of the other phenomenal occurrences 
          in the body and mind, such as stiffness and upward and downward movements 
          of the abdominal wall, and of bending, stretching, lifting, stepping, 
          and so on will be distinctly known part by part when contemplation is 
          in full swing. When realisation comes, it will be fully appreciated 
          with awareness that these are mere characteristic of <i>anicca</i> (impermanence) 
          and of misery constituting the nature of <i>anatta </i>without substance 
          or <i>atta. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When there is such realisation of the existence 
          of only <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama, </i>it will be found that what the 
          Buddha had preached as being "impermanence", misery and <i>anatta -</i> 
          Non-Self, is absolutely true and correct. This awareness and understanding 
          will enhance one's faith in the Buddha as really an Omniscient. Belief 
          in the Dhamma, as preached by the Buddha, will get firmer or strengthened. 
          Faith in the Sanghas who are diligently practising according to the 
          teachings of the Buddha will become stronger. Depending upon the degree 
          of faith and belief, <i>vicikiccha </i>(doubts) will be cleared away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thenceforth, when contemplation and noting 
          is further carried on, progress will be made leading one to the achievement 
          of the knowledge of Vipassana, ten stages in all, step by step towards 
          Nibbana, where <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>and all miseries will come 
          to a cessation through the attainment of <i>ariya-magga-nana. </i>Then, 
          awareness or consciousness firmly takes place that there is no such 
          thing as <i>anatta - </i>being or "Self", and that the entire so-called 
          body is composed of only two things - <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama. </i> 
          As such, all false views <i>(micchaditthi) </i>commencing from <i>attaditthi 
          </i>and <i>sakkayaditthi </i>will be completely free or eradicated. 
          This explains how the arrow of <i>Dittha </i>has been fully got rid 
          of. A Motto relevant to the foregoing explanatory account has been composed 
          as follows. Let us recite thus:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Nothing to be thought of as "I" - an 
            individual or Self except as an aggregate of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This illustrates how a Sotapanna is free 
          from <i>sakkayaditthi </i>- a false view of Self. While contemplating 
          and noting, or imagining, knowledge of awareness is clear that "there 
          is only an aggregate of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>which is arising 
          and dissolving <i>incessantly, and </i>that there is no such thing as 
          an <i>atta - a </i>being, or "I", or "Self". And then, there is no doubt 
          about the efficacy and noble moral qualities of <i>sila </i>(morality), 
          <i>samadhi </i>(concentration) and <i>panna </i>(wisdom). 'Firm conviction 
          and faith without a tinge of doubt also arise that "only by practising 
          to gain accomplishment of the qualities of <i>sila, samadhi </i>and 
          panna, can Nibbana be reached. In particular, only by the true realisation 
          of the characteristics of anicca, etc., through continuous contemplation 
          of the arising phenomena of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama, </i>can Nibbana 
          be attained." Relating to this, a motto has been framed. Please follow 
          the recitation as follows: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Have nothing to doubt about the practice 
            and the Triple Gem."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is how to get rid of <i>vicikiccha, 
          </i>the doubt, in connection' with Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha as well 
          as the noble practices involving morality. It also indicates how a Sotapanna 
          is freed of sceptical doubts. This is the manner how one can be fully 
          liberated from the piercing arrows of <i>vicikiccha </i>according to 
          <i>Mahakarunasamipatti desana.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If dispelled from the false view of <i>Sakkaya 
          (sakkayaditthi) </i>and doubt <i>(vicikiccha), </i>other <i>kilesas 
          </i>such as <i>raga</i>, <i>dosa, moha, mana, </i>etc., which can drag 
          a person down to the Four Nether Worlds, will be eradicated. All bad 
          <i>kammas, </i>the resultant effect of evil deeds which can cause one 
          to land in <i>Apaya </i>existence will also be eradicated. Hence, if 
          one becomes a Sotapanna through the practice of Vipassana meditation, 
          one will escape from the harm inflicted by the arrows which can cause 
          misery by pulling him down to the realm of the four <i>Apayas. </i>The 
          Buddha had therefore preached his noble Dhamma with great Compassion 
          towards all beings. I am following in the footsteps of the Lord Buddha 
          in imparting His Teachings (Dhamma) with a view to enable beings to 
          escape from such harmful arrows.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To put it in, a nutshell, if one proceeds 
          to contemplate and note after his attainment of the status of Sotapanna 
          (the first stage of progressive sanctification), he will become a Sakadagami, 
          and then, an Anagami. On attainment of Anagamiship he or she will again 
          be freed from the arrows of <i>kamaraga </i>and <i>byapada - </i>ill-will 
          and hatred. Thereafter, if contemplation and noting is further carried 
          on, he will attain Arahatship after reaching <i>Arahatta-magga-phala. 
          </i>On becoming an Arahat, the stinging arrows of <i>rupa-raga, arupa-raga, 
          mana </i>and <i>avijja </i>(ignorance) with which he was wrapped up 
          as an Anagami, will be totally liberated. It means that all arrows of 
          <i>akusala </i>smeared with <i>kilesas will </i>be completely extirpated. 
          That is why the Noble Arahats, after Parinibbana, will be totally emancipated 
          from all kinds of sufferings attached to <i>rupa-nama-sankhara, </i>for 
          having been freed from all kinds of arrows. This would bring them everlasting 
          peace and happiness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Before reaching the state of a worthy Arahat, 
          even an Anagami who can yet be pierced by the arrows of <i>rupa-raga, 
          arupa-raga, </i>etc., would still be subjected to conditioned miseries 
          of existence <i>(sankhara-dukkha) </i>after reaching the abodes of Form 
          and Formless Brahmas. As for Sotapannas and Sakadagamis, since the sharp 
          arrows of <i>kamaraga, </i>etc., can penetrate them, they will have 
          their rebirths in existences of human beings and Devas whereby they 
          have to go through miserable conditions of old age, death, etc. Finding 
          the beings stuck with those arrows, the Buddha's heart was filled with 
          pity and thus, with a feeling of deep compassion, He had preached the 
          Dhamma. despite the fact that he had to undergo a lot of hardships solely 
          for the sake of the emancipation of all beings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In particular, having observed and found 
          the worldlings (<i>Puthujjanas</i>) suffering in misery for being struck 
          with such arrows piercing through their material <i>khandhas, </i>the 
          Buddha reflected and realised that there was no other person except 
          Him who could remove or extract those sharp-pointed arrows. The Compassionate 
          Buddha therefore went on preaching the Dhamma.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>"Annatara maya </i>- Except me, the 
          Buddha, <i>sallanam uddhata - </i>capable<i> </i>of extracting the sharp-pointed 
          arrows, <i>anno kici - </i>any<i> </i>other single person, <i>natthiti 
          - </i>is not in existence. <i>Passantanam - </i>Seeing<i>, </i>nay, 
          having seen or observed as such, <i>buddhanam bhagavantanam - </i>in 
          the hearts of Buddhas, <i>sattesu - </i>towards the beings, <i>mahakaruna 
          - great </i>compassion, <i>okkamati </i>- has arisen." It has been stated 
          as such in the Patisambhidamagga Pali.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Buddha's compassion towards all beings 
          is equally balanced without distinction irrespective of whether a person 
          is intimate or unfamiliar. The degree of compassion bestowed upon Rahula, 
          his own son born while he was a prince, was on the same level as he 
          had conferred upon Ashin Devadatta, who had through animosity done grievous 
          wrong to him. At one time, Ashin Devadatta in collusion with King Ajatasattu 
          conspired to assassinate the Buddha. They incited the royal elephant 
          by the name of Nalagiri, to make an assault on the Buddha while on His 
          rounds for alms. This elephant had a ferocious propensity and trampled 
          to death all persons whom it met on its way. As instructed by Ashin 
          Devadatta, the mahouts fed this great Nalagiri elephant with liquor 
          profusely and released the big animal along the road where Buddha was 
          to seek alms.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On that occasion, a good number of Sanghas 
          were in the company of the Enlightened One. The huge elephant being 
          intoxicated, rushed forward to attack the Buddha. Even human beings 
          under the influence of liquor used to do things which ought not to be 
          done or speak what ought not to be spoken. Being an animal, there is 
          nothing to be said of the elephant which came rushing violently towards 
          the Buddha to bore Him to death with its tusks. Seeing this terrible 
          state of affairs, the Bhikkhus, in great anxiety, requested the Buddha 
          to retreat and avoid the elephant. The Lord Buddha, however, preached 
          to His disciples as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Agacchatha bhikkhave </i>Come! Come! 
          0, my</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">Disciple Bhikkhus! Do not shun, 
          <i>mabhayittha </i>- Do not</font> <font face="Arial" size="2">fear. 
          <i>Atthanametam bhikkhave anavakaso, yam parupakka </i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>mena 
          tathagatam Jivita voropeyya - O, </i>Bhikkhus! No other person will 
          have the opportunity to plot and strive to cause death to the Buddha. 
          <i>Anupakkamena bhikkhave tathagata parinibbayanti - O, </i>Bhikkhus! 
          It is usual for the Buddhas to enter into Parinibbana without being 
          subjected to harmful death by anyone through conspiracy or attempt. 
          His disciple - Sanghas, nevertheless, pleaded three times repeatedly. 
          However, the Buddha remained adamant and gave his reply as stated above 
          three times in succession.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thereupon, Ashin Ananda, becoming frightfully 
          anxious of the impending disaster, took his standing posture in front 
          of the Lord Buddha with the intention of sacrificing his own life first 
          in place of the Exalted One. The Buddha asked him three times to make 
          way. However, since Ashin Ananda failed to comply, the Buddha had to 
          make him move from the place he had taken up by the exercise of His 
          supernatural powers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After having removed the Venerable Ashin 
          Ananda, Buddha radiated his <i>metta (mettaya phari) </i>toward Nalagiri, 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="2">the elephant. This reveals the primary 
          importance of the quality of <i>metta. </i>Feeling of pity that had 
          arisen can also be regarded as developing a supplement <i>(appadhana) 
          </i>just as radiating with <i>mahakaruna-samapatti, </i>as has been 
          earlier stated. As a result, the big elephant, Nalagiri, which had been 
          showered upon with loving-kindness and compassion by the Buddha, suddenly 
          turned sober. Its mind became mild and gentle. Faith and reverence in 
          the Buddha arose in him too. The huge creature then respectfully approached 
          the Buddha, dropped its trunk from its vertical position, and then squatted 
          at the feet of the Exalted One. Thereupon, the Buddha after caressing 
          the elephant, Nalagiri on the forehead with His right hand admonished 
          it thus:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Oh, Nalagiri! You should abstain from 
          committing wrong to a Buddha such as me. If wrong or evil acts were 
          committed, serious trouble and suffering will come upon you. Don't get 
          drunk or intoxicated. Neither should you be forgetful. If you are not 
          mindful or rather forgetful and fail to give thought to yourself, you 
          cannot reach an existence where happy condition prevails. To reach a 
          noble abode of life existence you should cultivate noble practice in 
          yourself and do things on your own in a virtuous way."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	From that time onwards, Nalagiri, the 
          huge elephant was transformed into a well-tamed creature fully </font><font face="Arial" size="2">accomplished 
          with the five noble precepts (<i>pancasila</i>). In the past, he used 
          to trample down people to death. From then on</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> 
          he abstained from killing others. This is the manner in which the Lord 
          Buddha admonished to the unruly elephant which had once attempted to 
          make a fatal attack on Him, by inculcating a benevolent spirit of loving-kindness 
          <i>(metta) </i>and great compassion <i>(karuna) </i>with an equally 
          balanced </font><font face="Arial" size="2">degree of love, pity and 
          compassion as he had bestowed upon His own son, Rahula.</font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">

          drifting along the mid-stream of <i>tanha. Iti - </i>As<i> </i>such,

</i>beings, <i>mahakaruna - </i>Great<i> </i>Compassion with pity, <i>okkamati 
          </i>- has arisen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The term <i>"tanha" </i>conveys 
          the meaning of thirst or lust. Being desirous of seeing and enjoying 
          the pleasures of sight, and becoming pleasurable with attachment, without 
          being contented, to all that have been seen and enjoyed, is merely thirst 
          for a beautiful sight. No matter what one may have seen - good and pleasant 
          sights of an unlimited scope, his thirst for it remains unquenched and 
          discontented. In the same way, getting unsatisfied with what is heard 
          in respect of any good and pleasant sound, as desired, is but a thirsty 
          <i>tanha. So </i>also is thirsty <i>tanha </i>in respect of good smell 
          and fragrance, good taste with great appetite, of good touch or contact, 
          and of imagination. <i>Tanha, </i>in fact, occurs unceasingly in everything 
          that is seen, heard and so on. It is arising all the time everywhere. 
          'The moment one gets up from sleep, what is desirable is invariably 
          thought of or imagined. One has found pleasure in oneself. He also finds 
          pleasure in others as well as in all properties or goods or commodities 
          for his own consumption. Because of this pleasurable attachment with 
          the thirst of <i>tanha, </i>one has continuous rebirths, one existence 
          after another. In every form of existence, one has to go through the 
          process of old age or decay, disease and death. Having had to seek what 
          is needed or desirable, suffering and misery take place. And then, for 
          having his binding duty to manage and look after all that have been 
          obtained or have come into his possession, one is to undergo misery 
          or rather becomes miserable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All these miseries are due to <i>tanha 
          </i>which is always in thirst that grows like a creeper. One is unable 
          to overcome this<i> tanha </i>from which he cannot get away. Hence, 
          this <i>tanha</i> is similar to a big net that has spread over all beings. 
          Animals which are caught in a net cannot escape. Death is hanging over 
          their heads. Much in the same way, beings who are trapped in the net 
          <i>of tanha </i>cannot take to flight elsewhere. In every existence, 
          sufferings take place because everyone gets old, sick and meets with 
          death. Having perceived and observed such miserable conditions in which 
          beings are wallowing, it had moved the Buddha to pity and great compassion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Moreover, a person who is drifting in mid-stream 
          will be carried by the current of water. It is likely that he will soon 
          be drowned. In like manner, beings are compelled to oblige and follow 
          as induced by <i>tanha. </i>They are, therefore, landing in the four 
          <i>Apayas </i>for having done immoral acts. Sometimes, for having done 
          good deeds or good <i>kamma, </i>they reach the world of human beings 
          and Devas. Even in these existences <i>of </i>human beings and Devas, 
          they have to suffer the miseries of old age, sickness and death. The 
          Buddha therefore had Great Compassion towards beings who have been suffering 
          and drifting with the tide <i>of tanha.</i></font><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Ditthi</i> means the heretical view, 
          erroneous belief and wrong conception. To think with loving attachment, 
          considering oneself as a living being, or an <i>atta</i>, individual 
          or 'Self', in spite of the fact that in the personalities of themselves 
          there exists only a continual phenomenal process of <i>rupa</i> and 
          <i>nama</i>, is mere <i>attaditthi</i>. It is also called <i>sakkayaditthi</i>. 
          "<i>Sakkaya</i>" means an aggregate of <i>rupas</i> and <i>namas</i> 
          which obviously exists in the so-called body. To think of these aggregates 
          of <i>rupas</i> and <i>namas</i> as a living being, or an <i>atta</i> 
          - being, or "I" or "Self', is nothing but <i>ditthi</i>. It is known 
          as <i>sakkayaditthi</i>, because of an erroneous conception or false 
          belief in this aggregate of <i>rupa-nama</i>. An instance may be cited 
          as for example, at the moment when seeing takes place, the eye - <i>rupa</i> 
          obviously exists. The eye and the sight (object that is seen) are also 
          <i>rupa</i>. The knowing mind which sees is<i> nama.</i> Only these 
          two  the <i>rupa</i> and <i>nama</i> - are obviously present. However, 
          ordinary worldlings are under the impression that what is seen and known, 
          is "Self', or "I". The sight - <i>rupa</i> in one's own body which is 
          seen by the eye is also misconceived as "I". If it is thought of as 
          a reality, it is but '<i>sakkayaditthi</i>' In respect of what is obviously 
          seen and known at the moment of hearing, etc., if it is imagined or 
          thought of as "I" or "Self", it amounts to holding the view of '<i>sakkayaditthi</i>'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It becomes <i>"sassataditthi" </i>if it 
          is misconceived that an <i>atta </i>- being. or 'Self' is perpetually 
          existing based upon the false view of <i>sakkayaditthi </i>and also 
          that after death it has transmigrated to ' reside in another body. On 
          the other hand, it is <i>"ucchedaditthi", if </i>'it is conceived or 
          thought of as complete annihilation of existence after death and that 
          there is no <i>kusalakamma </i>and <i>akusalakamma. </i>Again, if it 
          is thought of as having no good or bad resultant effects of that <i>kamma, 
          </i>it <i>is duccharita </i>micchaditthi. One who holds a false view 
          of <i>'ucchedaditthi' </i>is<i> </i>likely to entertain the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">false 
          doctrine of '<i>duccharita micchaditthi'. </i>This <i>'duccharita micchaditthi' 
          </i>is extremely faulty and highly culpable. If this <i>micchaditthi 
          </i>or false view is entertained, committing of vices and doing demeritorious 
          acts will not be avoided. Nor will meritorious deeds or actions be performed. 
          In other words, those who have the false view of <i>micchaditthi </i>will<i>
</i>not hesitate to do all kinds of vices. Hence, a person who has accepted 
          this false view will definitely land in hell after death. Furthermore, 
          to believe in and revere a false Buddha, or a person impersonating as 
          Buddha, is a kind of false belief - "<i>micchaditthi</i>"<i>. </i>Believing 
          in false practices as being genuine is also another type of <i>micchaditthi. 
          </i>For example, to have a firm belief in the performance of rites involving 
          the sacrifice of living beings, and by doing so, demerits would be eliminated, 
          and that merits will also be gained, is a kind of <i>micchaditthi, </i>i.e. 
          believing in false practices and seeing things wrongly without understanding 
          what they truly are.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Prior to the appearance of Buddhas, or 
          though Buddha has appeared, those who have not heard of the Truth of 
          the Dhamma and those who misunderstood the Truth of the Teachings (Dhamma) 
          would readily accept and adhere to any one of the false doctrines mentioned 
          in the foregoing. All over the world, the majority of the people have 
          accepted and believed such false doctrines. All those who fail to fully 
          appreciate the Buddha's Dhamma, have <i>attaditthi, a </i>false view 
          to which they are clinging blindly that <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas </i>are 
          merely '<i>atta</i> being', 'Self or 'I'. Hence, the statement that 
          "all beings are caught in a net of <i>ditthi </i>and they are drifting 
          in the current of <i>ditthi" </i>is really true and correct. All beings 
          who have accepted such false doctrines as <i>"uccheda" </i>belief and 
          "<i>duccharita miccha</i>" are likely to land in the Four Nether Worlds. 
          However, in the case of those who adhere to the belief of "sassata", 
          there is likelihood of their gaining <i>kusalakamma by </i>lending help 
          to other fellow beings, and by getting rid of some <i>akusala, </i>demerits, 
          to a reasonable extent, inasmuch as they have a belief in the propriety 
          of what ought to be done or not, expecting to gain benefits and happiness 
          in the life hereafter. For such good actions or <i>kusalakamma, </i>there 
          is still hope for them to reach good and noble existences after demise. 
          Nevertheless, bad deeds or immoral actions are included in what they 
          believe as "things that ought to be done". Such wrong or erroneous <i>kamma 
          -</i> actions are expounded in Pali Atthakathas. These are actions, 
          such as those relating to filing other beings in performing rituals, 
          or boiling snails and oysters alive, etc., to save themselves as they 
          have said, from Samsaric misery (<i>vatta</i>). Though such acts might 
          be considered as good deeds from their own point of view, killing of 
          sentient beings cannot possibly be regarded as acts of virtue from which 
          merits can be derived because of the fact that victims will surely have 
          their disapproval and cannot be a consenting party.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There is every likelihood of these heretics 
          going down to the four Apayas where they would suffer misery for their 
          demeritorious or immoral actions which might appear to them as being 
          good and proper. And then, one who rigidly adheres to <i>Sassata</i> 
          and <i>Atta</i> Doctrines will not believe in the truth of the Buddha's 
          Dhamma which says: "There is no such thing as <i>'atta' </i>but only 
          a continuing process of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>according to their 
          phenomenal nature. There is only the causative effect of <i>rupa </i>and 
          <i>nama; </i>and if <i>samudayatanha, </i>clinging attachment, is eradicated 
          by indulging in the practice of meditation so as to extinguish <i>kilesa, 
          </i>which is the cause, the suffering effect of the continuum of <i>rupa 
          </i>and <i>nama</i> totally ceases and becomes extinct." Such being 
          the case, they will be passing through a succession of births in <i>samsara 
          </i>and then, continually suffer the miseries of old age, sickness and 
          death because of continued existences. This resultant effect clearly 
          reveals their failure to reach the zone of freedom from miseries for 
          having been caught and entangled in the net of <i>Dittha. </i>Thus, 
          for being drifted in the current of <i>ditthi, </i>'they are suffering 
          the miseries of <i>samsara </i>without a break. The current of <i>tanha, 
          </i>as has been stated, is generally flowing into the realm of four 
          <i>Apayas. </i>Therefore, all those beings who are not yet liberated 
          from the bonds of <i>tanha </i>and <i>ditthi </i>are immensely suffering 
          after descending to the four nether worlds. Having clearly perceived 
          this miserable condition of life, Buddha was moved to have pity towards 
          all living beings. Emulating the example as shown by the Buddha, our 
          male and female benefactors and all those who desire to follow His exemplary 
          conduct can also try to develop <i>karuna.</i></font></p>

          vehemently producing blazing flames. Having also seen living beings 
          enveloped in such blaze, Great Compassion had arisen in the Buddha.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The above statement reveals that all beings 
          are badly burnt and consumed by eleven <i>aggis </i>(fires) which may 
          be enumerated as lust or passion, anger or hatred, erroneous conception, 
          birth, decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. Among 
          these, the fires of <i>raga </i>are those that are prone to pleasurable 
          attachment. What is called <i>tanha </i>and <i>lobha </i>are also <i>raga, 
          </i>passionate desires. How they are being burnt is: "Pleasurable attachment 
          to the eye, the object which is seen, and the knowing-mind, may be said 
          to be the fires of <i>raga </i>which are raging. From the stage of "seeing", 
          one becomes attached to his own "eyes" lovingly. Also, the object which 
          is found agreeable by sight is found to be pleasurable. Particularly, 
          pleasurable attachment to what is seen, is taking place. It is not only 
          the 'sight - '<i>rupa</i>' - the beauty - that is seen and appreciated, 
          but also the entire body of a woman or a man. Thus the sensation arises 
          from sight or what is seen, is found pleasurable which in turn invokes 
          desirable attachment to it. This feeling which occurs is nothing but 
          the burning fires of <i>raga. </i>If<i> </i>the thing that is desired 
          is not yet available, it will be craved for or yearned. He will think 
          <i>of </i>trying to get it, maybe by hook or by crook. Sometimes, burning 
          desire may occur to the extent of having a reaction in losing one's 
          own appetite to eat and of suffering from insomnia. He may also be planning 
          to keep intact things which have been acquired. The arising of this 
          pleasurable desire is the burning <i>raga</i> vehement passion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Ordinary people, however, think of this 
          burning sensation of <i>raga</i> as being pretty good. Therefore, they 
          are always eagerly making efforts to enjoy such sensual pleasures with 
          attachment. Whether in the matter of family affairs or business affairs 
          or affairs relating to human relations, they are constantly worried. 
          They may even probably think it enjoyable to be worrying as such. As 
          a matter of fact, they are being consumed by the fires of raga. If raga 
          were driven out or expelled, it will become obvious that all these imaginations 
          which have to be invoked and anxieties which are cropping up, will be 
          found as being similar to miseries suffered by a person from burns. 
          Hence, <i>ragaggina</i> - the flaming red-hot raga, was perceived by 
          the Buddha as being burning with a fury.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the same way, when hearing takes place, 
          the ear, the sound that is heard, and the knowing-mind are found to 
          be pleasurable. This is the '<i>raga</i>' which is burning. In matters 
          relating to the odour, the nose, the knowing-mind that occurs, and when 
          eating, the tongue, the taste and consciousness that arises, as also 
          when touching and imagining, similar occurrences which are happening, 
          may be considered as being subjected to burns. Briefly put, pleasurable 
          attachment to all sensations which arise obviously at every moment of 
          seeing, hearing, contacting (touching) and knowing, are nothing but 
          the fires of <i>raga</i> that are burning. The flames of <i>raga</i> 
          are raging furiously depending upon those that have arisen from the 
          six sense-doors. It is just like inflammable material such as firewood 
          and kerosene that easily catch fire. The more the material is highly 
          combustible, the more the fire becomes vehement. In the same manner, 
          the more the sense-objects are found highly pleasurable, the more the 
          fires of <i>raga </i>become furious.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Similarly, the fires of anger are burning. 
          It is more obvious when the mind becomes miserable with burning sensations 
          as one gets angry. The man in anger, however, may feel pleased with 
          the anger that has arisen in him. As regards <i>moha, </i>it is difficult 
          to understand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If a thought arises that everything which 
          conspicuously occurs emanating from what is seen and heard, is permanent, 
          everlasting, good and pleasurable, and that every such thing is <i>"atta" 
          </i>or "Self", it is simply <i>"moha" </i>In short, what is wrongly 
          conceived is <i>moha. </i>Erroneous understanding or misconception which 
          veils the truth of the knowledge of <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and <i>anatta 
          </i>in respect of all phenomenal occurrences that arise from the six 
          sense-doors is to be regarded as <i>"moha " </i>in<i> </i>flames. The 
          manner in which the fires of <i>moha </i>are burning is hard to be understood 
          by ordinary worldlings. Only when the true characteristics of <i>anicca, 
          dukkha </i>and <i>anatta </i>are clearly known, the way <i>moha is </i>burning 
          can be realised. Thus <i>"moha." </i>includes not knowing what is true, 
          being under delusion, does things which ought not to be done, and plans 
          which ought not to be planned, or speaks what ought not to be spoken. 
          For such improper conduct or actions, disadvantages are bound to be 
          met with in the present lifetime. Also, throughout <i>Samsara, </i>sufferings, 
          such as miserable condition of <i>Apaya </i>life will be met. These 
          are the sufferings of burns caused by the fires of <i>"moha".</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The three kinds of fires - <i>raga</i>, 
          <i>dosa </i>and <i>moha </i>- just now stated, are the fires of <i>akusala 
          kilesa. </i>Then comes the fires of <i>jati</i>, etc., birth or existence, 
          etc., which are in fact the fires of <i>Samsaric</i> miseries. There 
          are eight of these. Of these eight, the three (3), viz: birth (<i>jati</i>), 
          old age <i>(jara) </i>and death <i>(marana) - </i>the<i> </i>three kinds 
          of fires - are conspicuous. However, there is food for thought relating 
          to the fires of <i>jati</i> to how fresh existence which has come into 
          being suffers the burning heat. To put it briefly, in every existence, 
          throughout one's lifetime, the miseries which a person encounters are 
          caused by the fires of <i>jati</i> (birth). Miseries in hell are to 
          be suffered because of one's rebirth in hell. Likewise, the miserable 
          conditions of the animal life and of Petas are met with because of rebirths 
          in the animal world as dogs, pigs, fowls, birds, etc., or, as <i>Petas</i>, 
          as the case may be. Those who are born of the poor parents will probably 
          be stricken with poverty throughout their lifetime. Persons who become 
          Devas or Brahmas are also suffering misery in their respective existences 
          merely because they have been reborn in those existences. A question 
          may arise from which source this burning heat of miseries has come. 
          It may be explained as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It has so happened because of the resultant 
          effect of <i>kilesa </i>and <i>kamma </i>which tend to cause to become 
          a "being" <i>(bhava). </i>These <i>kilesa </i>and <i>kamma </i>proceed 
          or originate from one's own dependence upon the resultant effect of 
          consciousness of sight which obviously comes into view through the medium 
          of the eye at the time of seeing, and of the consciousness of sound 
          through the ear at the moment of hearing, etc. That is the reason why 
          all consciousness or the knowing mind of the object of sight and sound 
          appearing and occurring through the eye and the ear at every moment 
          of seeing, hearing, etc., is to be-stated as the burning fire of <i>jati</i> 
          which brings forth new existences. To be quite candid, the new existence 
          of the fire of <i>jati</i> occurs from the upsurge of <i>kilesa </i>and 
          the effect of <i>kamma </i>based upon the act of seeing and so on. This 
          fire of <i>jati</i> having had the opportunity to take place at every 
          moment of seeing, hearing, etc., whenever seeing, hearing, etc., are 
          occurring; it may be said that the fire of <i>jati is </i>burning. The 
          fires of <i>jara </i>(old age) and <i>marana </i>(death) are occurring 
          and burning in the same manner. The only prominent thing is that old 
          age and death are clearly noticeable and visible in their true nature 
          as conditions worsen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">According to what has been stated, the 
          manner of the outbreak of fires of <i>jati, </i>etc., is as described 
          in the preaching contained in Aditta Sutta which run as <i>"cakkhu adittam 
          rupa aditta cakkhuvinnanam adittam </i>etc." In the prologue of this 
          <i>mahakarunasamapatti </i>since it has been stated ordinarily as: <i>"lokasanniva" 
          </i>which conveys the meaning of 'Burning the living being', it can 
          be interpreted to mean that the fires of <i>jati, </i>etc., are burning 
          in every existence wherever a being may be born. As such, all miseries 
          which are faced and suffered throughout the lifetime, for having first 
          come into being in every existence <i>(bhava), </i>are the burns caused 
          by the fire of <i>jati </i>that has initially conceived or projected. 
          In every existence, getting gradually advanced in age with the obvious 
          signs of grey hairs, short-sightedness or blurring vision, and becoming 
          hard of hearing (deaf), is due to the burning heat of <i>jara (</i>old 
          age). Eventually, the inevitable death which takes place, is the burning 
          heat of the fire of <i>marana. </i>In every kind of existence, these 
          fires of <i>jara </i>and <i>marana </i>which are burning, are quite 
          conspicuous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, anxiety, grief, wailing, bereavement 
          and lamentation due to the loss and death of relatives, loss and destruction 
          of property or of business enterprise, etc., are the burning fires of 
          grief and lamentation. Also in every existence, generally various kinds 
          of physical sufferings are to be faced. There are also heart-breaking 
          moments with extreme anxiety. These happenings are the fires of <i>domanassa 
          </i>(dejection) and <i>upayasa</i> (despair) which one has to undergo<i>
</i>unavoidably. For having observed that the beings are undergoing 
          severe misery and suffering in the raging fires (altogether eleven in 
          kind), explanation has been given as stated below to show how Buddha 
          was moved to pity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Annatara maya </i>- Except me, the Buddha, 
          <i>tassa nibbapeta - </i>capable<i> </i>of extinguishing all these burning 
          fires, <i>anno koci</i> - any other single person, <i>natthi - </i>cannot<i>
</i>be found, or, rather, is not in existence. <i>Iti - </i>Such being 
          the case, <i>passantanam </i>- having perceived, <i>buddhanam bhagavantanam 
          </i>- in the persons of Buddhas, <i>sattesu - </i>towards<i> </i>living 
          beings, <i>mahakaruna - </i>great compassion, <i>okkamati - </i>has 
          occurred.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">All living beings are subjected to the 
          eleven kinds of fires such as <i>raga </i>and so forth. Therefore, the 
          Buddha had Great Compassion towards those living beings realising that 
          there was no one except him to come to their succour. Yes, indeed, these 
          beings are really pitiable. Since, not only one but eleven fires are 
          burning them up; the miseries they have to undergo must be awfully terrible. 
          There is no one who could give instructions to these poor pitiable being 
          to escape from the burning flames except the Compassionate Supreme Buddha. 
          Knowing fully well the fate of all living beings, pity had arisen in 
          the heart of the Buddha, and this feeling of deep compassion had caused 
          him to give his teaching revealing the way to happiness, and guiding 
          them to follow the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path - <i>Sila, Samadhi 
          </i>and <i>Panna -, </i>for the entire period of forty-five years of 
          his teachings. We are now recounting His Noble Teachings and giving 
          instructions to you all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Having already covered a wide range relating 
          to the occurrence of <i>mahakaruna </i>in the mind of the Lord Buddha, 
          let us now develop the feeling of <i>karuna </i>after reflecting upon 
          the miserable conditions of the living beings who are suffering from 
          various kinds of "fires" and distress, as has been illustrated in the 
          foregoing. Now please follow the recitation:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Living beings are pierced by the arrows 
            of <i>raga, </i>etc. They are also caught in the nets of <i>ditthi 
            </i>and <i>tanha. </i>They are drifting in the current in the mid-stream 
            of <i>ditthi </i>and <i>tanha, </i>and are burnt by the fires of <i>raga, 
            </i>etc. Hence, may all those pitiable living beings be liberated 
            from misery."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The method of developing <i>karuna </i>as 
          has just been stated is for the sake of gaining perfection and merits. 
          However, in the case of a person with special perfection <i>(Paramitas), 
          </i>he could achieve <i>appana-jhana </i>even while developing in the 
          manner stated. If purposely desirous of developing so as to gain <i>karuna-jhana, 
          </i>it should not be developed starting from a beloved person, etc., 
          as is done in the case of developing <i>metta. </i>It should not also 
          be developed commencing from a person of the opposite sex. Nor should 
          <i>karuna </i>be developed beginning from a person who is already dead 
          and gone. <i>Karuna </i>must be bestowed first upon a pitiable person 
          who is in dire distress by developing pity and reciting as: "May he 
          be free from misery." Only when <i>jhana </i>has been achieved by developing 
          as stated, one should proceed to develop <i>karuna </i>towards the person 
          who is dear to him. Thereafter, a neutral person should be radiated 
          with <i>karuna. </i>The last person towards whom <i>karuna </i>should 
          be developed is a person hostile to you (an enemy). While developing 
          <i>karuna </i>towards an enemy, if anger arises, this feeling of anger 
          should be suppressed as in the case of developing <i>metta, </i>and 
          then only afterwards, <i>karuna </i>be developed towards a beloved person, 
          a neutral person, an enemy, and oneself, equally balanced on all four 
          of them with pity so as to be accomplished - with <i>simasambheda. </i>After 
          that, according to the fourth method, practice should be made with diligence 
          to complete the realisation or achievement of all three kinds of <i>karuna-jhana. 
          </i>Well, it is now fairly comprehensive in describing the manner of 
          developing <i>karuna. </i>So let us proceed to instruct relating to 
          the manner of developing <i>muditta.</i></font></p>

        manner of developing Mudita</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>'Mudita" </i>means rejoicing 
          and getting pleased. It is rejoicing with others in their happiness 
          and prosperity. Some people do not wish to see others prosper, happy 
          and successful in their life's career. This reflects the nature of Envy 
          and Jealousy. In Pali language, it is called <i>"issa". </i>The said 
          <i>"mudita" </i>is diametrically opposite to "<i>issa</i>", the Envy. 
          A person who is overwhelmed with the feeling of envy will not be desirous 
          of seeing others becoming prosperous and happy. Nor is he inclined to 
          see others being endowed with a large number of attendants (retinue), 
          handsome looks, and good education; nor does he wish to see others reaching 
          a higher status in life and getting promotion in official rank and position. 
          On the other hand, a person with <i>mudita </i>gets pleased and rejoiced 
          in finding and seeing others successful in their business or official 
          career. He can bring into his mind the feeling of joy and pleasure, 
          saying: "May ... ... be prosperous." This bents of mind or rather goodwill 
          is <i>"mudita". </i>It is indeed a Dhamma - the nature of noble-mindedness 
          with extreme moral purification.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Feeling of <i>mudita </i>should 
          be spread out. or radiated, first and foremost, to a very intimate friend 
          who is in the habit of speaking with a smile on his face. Or, when a 
          beloved one who has become wealthy and prosperous, smartly dressed with 
          happiness is seen or heard <i>(modati vatayam satto aho sutthu), mudita 
          - </i>feeling<i> </i>of rejoicing - should be invoked uttering: "0h! 
          How happy he is. 0,<b> </b>very fine indeed (or rather, how good it 
          is)."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the transliteration 
          of the statement as contained in the Visuddhimagga. Also in the Abhidhamma 
          Vibanga Pali, it has been preached as stated below:</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Bhikkhu - </i>A Bhikkhu, 
          <i>muditasahagatena cetasa, -</i> with the mind that occurs along with 
          <i>muditta, kathanca - </i>how, <i>ekam disam pharitva </i>- by radiating 
          towards one region, <i>Viharati </i>- will it reside or remain staying? 
          <i>Seyathapi nama - </i>Citing<i> </i>as an example, <i>piyam manapam 
          - </i>deserving<i> </i>of love and adoration, <i>ekam puggalam - </i>an<i>
</i>individual, <i>disva </i>having seen, <i>mudito </i>- becoming pleased 
          and happy, <i>assa </i>it so happens. <i>Evameva - Similarly, sabbe 
          satta - </i>to<i> </i>all living beings, <i>muditaya pharati - </i>it<i>
</i>is spread out with <i>mudita.</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the statement given 
          in the Visuddhimagga as earlier stated in regard to developing <i>mudita, 
          </i>it is shown how happiness had occurred as: <i>"(aho sadhu aho sutthu) 
          - 0, </i>how good or fine it is!" It has not been stated in the manner 
          usually uttered by rote at the present day, by Sanghas, Bhikkhus and 
          laymen as - (<i>Yathaladdha sampattito ma vigacchantu), </i>i.e., "may 
          not be deprived of or diminished in all riches and wealth that have 
          already come into possession". However, in explaining the decision made 
          at random, it has been stated as: <i>kammassaka satta, te kassa ruciya... 
          pattasampattito va na parihayissantiti evam pavattakammassakatadassanapadatthana. 
          </i>In this statement, what has been explained as "Living beings having 
          had, their own individual <i>kamma </i>which produces the advantageous 
          results that ripen, since they are the masters of their own destiny 
          and are reaping the fruits, the seeds of which they have sown in the 
          past, how can they be deprived of and diminished in their wealth by 
          the will or influence of others?" is in conformity with the statement, 
          "<i>ma</i> <i>vigacchantu - </i>may not be deprived of and diminished". 
          Hence, in developing <i>mudita, </i>what is usually uttered by rote 
          by the majority of the people, will be expounded.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">It a person endowed with 
          wealth and happiness is seen or heard, <i>mudita </i>should be developed 
          by bringing him into one's mind as. "May not this person's wealth diminish 
          and may he not suffer loss. May he be able to retain his wealth and 
          luxurious living status quo in full accomplishment, and be able to enjoy 
          happiness as before." Towards a large number of people, <i>mudita is 
          </i>to be developed likewise as: "May their wealth and prosperity which 
          have been acquired, be not diminished or lost; and may they be able 
          to retain their wealth in full with luxury and be as happy as before." 
          In this regard, the statement - "to have the full accomplishment of 
          his wealth and luxurious life" may be construed as not being fabulously 
          rich but as being fairly well off. <i>Mudita </i>can be developed visualising 
          with a deep feeling of joy towards a person who is fairly wealthy. Such 
          being the case, there is hardly anything to be said in particular in 
          the matter of radiating <i>mudita </i>towards a person of great affluence 
          for whom mudita can be developed with much more heartfelt rejoicing. 
          Let us therefore recite the motto which is relevant to the said two 
          types of persons:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"May all those people who are fully endowed 
            with wealth and prosperity, be accomplished with their wealth that 
            has been acquired, and be able to retain their wealth and prosperity 
            as before, and continue to live in opulence with happiness as before."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"May all those beings who are rich, be 
            as happy and prosperous as before."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Nevertheless, those living 
          beings who are said to be in misery are likely to enjoy happiness in 
          their own way according to circumstances under which they live. Even 
          those beings who were continuously suffering pain and misery in the 
          burning fires of hell were said to get relief at the time when the Supreme 
          Buddha and noble Arahats had made a visit to the realm of <i>Apaya</i> 
          hell and preached the Dhamma. Therefore, <i>mudita</i> can be very well 
          developed with a benevolent feeling towards all beings. The manner of 
          developing <i>mudita</i> is the same as in the case of developing <i>karuna</i>. 
          Let us develop by recitation. Please follow me:</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"May all beings be able to retain their

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This method of developing 
          <i>mudita</i> is in conformity with the instructions contained in the

          </i>" Next, we shall proceed to develop by reciting in accordance with

          being by virtue of the strength of his <i>kusalas </i>(merits), he will 
          be lacking in companions and attendants. It is clearly illustrated and 
          expounded in Atthakatha as resembling "One who is armless, or rather, 
          one who is without his hands after being cut - off, when becoming thirsty,

        is Upekkha?</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the principles 
          of Pali grammar, <i>upekkha</i>, means: <i>Upapattito yutthito - </i>as<i>
</i>may be appropriate, <i>ikkhatiti - </i>for<i> </i>being able to 
          see and observe things, <i>upekkha - </i>it is known as <i>"upekkha" 
          </i>i.e., to note and observe things keeping at heart, with equanimity, 
          and an equally balanced mind taking a neutral attitude without discrimination. 
          However, in the matter of the Brahmavihara, the term <i>"upekkha" </i>conveys 
          the sense denoting the feeling of indifference without being worried 
          by rejecting or discarding all kinds of anxiety, such as, wishing others 
          happy by radiating loving-kindness <i>(metta), </i>wishing others free 
          from misery with compassion <i>(karuna), </i>and wishing them to be 
          able to retain the same state of prosperity as before, without diminution, 
          by developing <i>mudita.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In causing to develop <i>metta bhavana, 
          </i>it shall be borne in mind as <i>"Sabbe satta avera hontu" - </i>may<i>
</i>all beings be free from danger, etc., in order to enable them to 
          gain happiness. Also in causing to develop <i>karuna-bhavana, </i>one 
          should keep at heart as <i>"Sabbe satta dukkha muccantu," - </i>may 
          all beings be liberated from misery so that beings may escape from misery 
          and sufferings. Likewise, in causing to develop <i>mudita bhavana, </i>one 
          should bring into his mind as <i>"Sabbe satta yatthaladdhasampattito 
          ma vigacchantu" </i>May all beings not be deprived of their wealth and 
          prosperity which they have acquired. As regards <i>"upekkha", </i>all 
          these mental states or formations that occur in one's mind worrying 
          about others' welfare should be dispelled. Hence, one should take an 
          indifferent attitude - with equanimity as: <i>"Sabbe satta kammassaka", 
          </i>which means - all beings are having their individual <i>kamma, </i>either 
          good or bad, depending upon their own actions done in the past as well 
          as present which cause to bring happiness or misery, as the case may 
          be; and these actions bear fruits as resultant effects which they have 
          inherited according to the law of <i>kamma. </i></font></p>

          if the Court trying the case has passed final orders, imposing a penalty 
          of imprisonment or a death sentence for having found him guilty of the 
          offence, no occasion will arise to be worried about his ineluctable 
          fate. In spite of this, if one gets worried over this matter, it would 
          amount to bringing upon himself both physical and mental distress. Only 
          if he can take an indifferent attitude without worrying himself, it 
          would bring him mental relief. Likewise, it would be quite natural for 
          him to bear in mind that the incident has occurred as a result of one's

          proficient in it. After arising from the trance of that third <i>jhana, 
          </i>he should ponder upon the faults of <i>metta-jhana </i>and so on. 
          It should be reflected as: "These <i>jhanas </i>being closely connected 
          and conjoined with the innermost feeling of loving attachment to beings 
          wishing them happiness, it is linked with love or hate. As it is combined 
          with joy and exultant feeling, the fault of it must be reflected upon 
          and understood as rude and vulgar. The noble faculty and attributes 
          of <i>upekkha </i>should be reflected upon and realised, imagining that 
          <i>upekkhajhana </i>which views things with indifference is indeed gentle 
          and meek. It is stated that only after reflecting as such, <i>upekkha 
          </i>should be developed with indifference towards a neutral person on 
          whom there is neither love nor hate. The manner of developing <i>upekkha

          that it is his own fate <i>(kamma) </i>to which he has become a victim. 
          After he has achieved the fourth <i>jhana </i>by contemplating as such, 
          he should proceed to develop <i>upekkha </i>towards a person who is 
          affectionate to him and towards persons who are hostile to him. When 
          radiating his feeling towards an enemy, if anger arises in him, it must 
          be subdued in the manner as prescribed in the case of developing <i>metta. 
          </i>After suppressing his anger, one should be able to contemplate with 
          a feeling of indifference, putting the mind equally balanced on all 
          four types of persons including himself, thereby accomplishing the quality 
          of <i>simasambheda. </i>After that, the fourth <i>jhana </i>will occur.

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This statement in brief 
          conveys the meaning that knowledge which realises with satisfaction 
          that only <i>kamma </i>is one's own property or possessions, is the 
          nearest or proximate cause for the development of <i>upekkha-bhavana. 
          </i>In this regards, there is one thing which calls for consideration. 
          This is in developing <i>metta, karuna </i>and <i>mudita - </i>is<i>
</i>it not true that one has to develop with a feeling of <i>metta </i>(loving<i>-</i>kindness) 
          to cause happiness to others, or, with a feeling of <i>karuna </i>(compassion) 
          to cause one to be liberated from misery, or with a feeling of <i>mudita 
          </i>(rejoicing) to cause one to retain his wealth which have come into 
          his possession without being diminished? However, in describing the 
          manner of realising and knowing by the expression <i>"kammassakata", 
          </i>it is stated that things will not happen according to the wish of 
          a person who is developing <i>metta, </i>etc., and that it happens according 
          to one's own <i>kamma. </i>If so, there is room to think and a question 
          may arise as to whether it would amount to saying that there is no beneficial 
          result by letting <i>metta </i>to be developed or rather, by developing 
          <i>metta </i>etc.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">There is an answer to it, 
          and that is, if there is no really serious <i>akusala-kamma - </i>immoral<i>
</i>actions and their effects, benefits can be derived in commensurate 
          with the strength of <i>metta, </i>etc., which is developed and radiated. 
          In any case, much as one may wish to have the full accomplishment of 
          his desire, It cannot be completely fulfilled. An example may be cited 
          on how it happens. Parents wishing their children to be well and happy, 
          always look after them and instil in the young minds both spiritual 
          values and moral virtues, providing them with everything they need. 
          Despite their efforts to see to their safety, health and comfort, some 
          children who are inclined to do what is improper, will not grow up in 
          the way their parents might wish them to be since they are subjected 
          to their own <i>kamma </i>which happens under different circumstances. 
          As things would happen under unavoidable circumstances, it will be unwise 
          to say that there is no need for the parents to bring up their children 
          in the way they would consider proper. Be it as it may, parental care 
          and attention must be given to their children who are still immature. 
          Generally speaking, it would bring beneficial results.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In achieving advantages 
          by developing <i>metta, </i>though beneficial results which may be derived, 
          fall short of the advantages received by the children from their parents, 
          it would be advisable to develop <i>metta bhavana. </i>Persons who received 
          loving-kindness showered upon them might not have benefited as much 
          as the person developing <i>metta </i>would have expected. However, 
          merits will be gained in any case, for having developed <i>metta </i>through 
          meditation. On the other hand in causing to develop <i>upekkha, </i>only 
          when feeling of indifference or equanimity can be borne as: "Only kamma 
          is one's own property in possession and things have happened and would 
          happen according to one's own individual <i>kamma </i>which automatically 
          produces an effect," the quality of <i>upekkha - </i>would be accomplished. 
          Such being the case, it is of paramount importance to make use of the 
          knowledge of <i>kammassakata - the </i>cause in the close proximity 
          of <i>upekkha, </i>as a basic factor. Because of this significance, 
          it has been mentioned to bear in mind that "nothing happens according 
          to the wish of the meditator, and that beings are subjected to their 
          own <i>kamma. </i>Accordingly, in order to be able to develop <i>kammassakata 
          </i>knowledge, Culakammavibhanga Sutta will be extracted from Uparipannasa 
          Pali Text, and narrated as follows.</font></p>

          Imagining that if charity were given, or in other words, if charitable 
          deeds were performed, his entire wealth would decline to the point of 
          total exhaustion, he had throughout his life abstained from making any 
          alms giving. Instructions were also given by him to his son and other 
          friends as stated below: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">"Anjananam khayam disva,<br/>

</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Anjananam -</i> Collyria 
          (i.e. stones producing colouring matter [pigment] applied to eye-lashes 
          to darken them), <i>khayam - </i>if ground several times will wear out, 
          or in other words, will be exhausted by attrition, d<i>isva ca </i>- 
          by observing and reflecting as such; <i>vammikanam - </i>and<i> </i>of 
          the nature of ant-hill, <i>sancayam -</i> which constitutes a large 
          accumulation brought about by the white-ants in carrying bit by bit 
          the dust in small quantity, <i>disva ca </i>- by observing and reflecting 
          as such, <i>madunam - and </i>of honey, <i>samaharam -</i> which represent 
          a collection made by the bees by carrying bit by bit gradually, <i>disva

          wise who has business acumen, <i>gharam - </i>the<i> </i>house, <i>avase 
          - </i>where he resides should likewise be put under his care, management 
          and control.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the advice or instruction 
          given to his son and others by Todeyya, the Brahmin. Collyrium is not 
          in use in Burma, but is popularly used in India. It is not an eye-lotion 
          but a colouring matter applied to the eyelids and lashes to look pretty. 
          A Rule of Discipline has been laid down prohibiting the Bhikkhus from 
          making use of this colouring matter. If this collyrium is made use of 
          several times, say, a hundred or a thousand times, the stone gets worn 
          out through attrition. In the same way, if donation is made even in 
          piecemeal, as time goes on, property in hand will gradually diminish 
          until it becomes exhausted or nothing is left. Imagining thus, no offering 
          of gifts even in small quantity should be made. This is what the statement 
          means.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, the ant-hill becomes 
          a big mound when gradually heaped up with particles of dust carried 
          over and deposited by the tiny white-ants. Taking cue from the manner 
          in which constant efforts are made by the tiny creatures in accumulating 
          the dust to form into a mound of earth or an anthill, money or property 
          should be gradually hoarded and accumulated slowly in piecemeal. Even 
          a <i>pya</i> (or a penny) should be saved and accumulated, and if done 
          so, in course of time, great wealth can be amassed. Hence, it is stated 
          that everything which comes into one's hands, should be stored up without 
          spending it.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">And next, tiny drops of 
          honey brought by the small bees stored up in trickles are not much. 
          But as these are carried by them and trickled out several times, a large 
          amount of honey is collected in due course. Taking lesson from this 
          illustration, though it may be a small sum of money, say, a penny or 
          a pya, one should gradually save up the money so as to get rich.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	What is meant by it is that the head 
          of the household or a family, should abstain from giving away even a 
          small sum of money without causing wastage, and carefully save and guard 
          the store of money and amass his fortune. At that time, Buddha was still 
          living and was delivering his preaching in the City of Savatthi. The 
          Sanghas, Buddha's disciples were all along present with the Exalted 
          One. Those people who had faith in the Dhamma took their refuge in the 
          three Jewels of Buddhism and became adherents of Buddha's Sasana. They 
          were observing the practices of morality - either the Five Precepts 
          or Eight Precepts and were accomplished with <i>sila.</i> They also 
          resorted to alms giving to their utmost capacity by making offerings 
          to Sanghas under the patronage of the Lord Buddha. They listened earnestly 
          to the sermons delivered by the Buddha daily, and carried on the practice 
          of meditation. Some of them became Sotapannas, or Sakadagamis, or Anagamis, 
          while some entered Bhikkhuhood, and then by developing Vipassana meditation, 
          had achieved <i>Arahatta-magga-phala,</i> eventually attaining Arahatship. 
          It was an opportune time affording a very rare opportunity to achieve 
          higher awakening consciousness of the Special Dhamma up to the highest 
          stage of sanctification. This golden opportunity was hard to come by.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">And yet, Todeyya, the Brahmin, 
          had no faith in and reverence for the Buddha. He had then already embraced 
          the doctrines and pretensions of the Brahmins. Hence, he had absolutely 
          no faith in the Buddha who had no place in his high estimation. As a 
          matter of fact, he had underestimated the noble qualities of the Lord 
          Buddha, the Exalted One. Being a Brahmin holding a different religious 
          concept which is of course a false view, he did not even care to listen 
          to the Buddha's sermon. Neither did he offer in charity anything, nay, 
          even a spoonful of boiled rice. Not only that, he used to address the 
          Buddha with disrespect as "Bho! Bho! " - the term which was used on 
          inferiors and equals. This term "Bho" is used to be translated in Burmese 
          as "Oh!" (Hi). However, nowadays, the usage of this expression is not 
          in vogue. It is usual to address a person by names such as "Maung Sein" 
          or "Maung Mya", etc., as the case may be. Therefore, it would appear 
          that he must have addressed the Buddha as "Maung Gautama". For having 
          disrespectfully spoken to the Buddha, the Exalted One, and also for 
          having pleasurable attachment to his properties with greed, when he 
          died, he was conceived in the womb of a bitch at his own house.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The bitch gave birth to 
          an infant dog in about one and a half or two months time. The young 
          man Subha was very fond of this little dog, which was in his previous 
          existence, Todeyya, the Brahmin. Subha lavishly fed the young animal, 
          his pet, with delicious food which he himself relished and let it sleep 
          in a comfortable bed. It was not that he knew of the little dog as his 
          father reincarnated. However, those who happened to live together in 
          their former existences are generally affectionate to one another. This 
          fact of Dhamma had been preached in the form of a verse as described 
          below:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">"Pubbeva sannivasena, <br/>
            paccuppannahitena va.<br/>
            Evam tam jayate pemam, <br/>
            Uppalamva yathodake.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Pubbe - </i>In<i> </i>the previous 
          existence, <i>sannivasena vii - </i>for having lived together, <i>paccuppannahitena 
          va - </i>and in the ensuring present existence for having caused to 
          bring benefit, <i>evam - </i>this kind of, <i>tam pemam - </i>peculiar<i>
</i>affection or love, <i>jayate - </i>is likely to spring up. <i>Kimiva 
           </i>How<i> </i>it happens is that, <i>yathodake - as </i>much as there 
          is water, </font><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Uppalam - the </i>lotus 
          or the water-lily, <i>jayate iva  </i>will continue to grow and develop 
          with vigour and freshness.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">It resembles a lotus plant 
          which sprouts with strength and vigour for so long as there is water. 
          Also love is likely to spring up for having lived in association in 
          the former existence. If the duration of living together is long, affection 
          will become deeper. The longer the period of close association the greater 
          the love. As such, there is nothing to be said in particular if joint 
          performances have been made in the matter of <i>kusala </i>(meritorious 
          acts). In the present existence also, a person may become more affectionate 
          to another who has rendered assistance. This is clearly evident perhaps 
          through personal experience. In the case of Todeyya who had become a 
          dog in his next existence, as he and his son were father and son living 
          together in his former existence, there is no wonder that Subha, the 
          rich man's son had his great loving attachment to the dog.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">One day, Buddha spread 
          out his penetratingly keen observation over the entire Universe with 
          his omniscience - Buddha's Wisdom - which preceded his trance of Great 
          Compassion <i>(Mahakarunasamapatti). </i>On reflection being made as 
          to who could listen to His sermon with all earnestness, and as to who 
          could attain the Special Dhamma, and who would be able to accept and 
          entertain his faith in the Triple Gem of Buddhism found Subha, the young 
          lad, appearing in His vision. Buddha, therefore, in the Morning on the 
          same day, in making His rounds for alms, purposely dropped in at the 
          house of Todeyya, the rich. On entering the house compound, the dog, 
          the reincarnated Todeyya, rushed forward towards the Buddha barking 
          sharply. The Enlightened One then admonished the animal, "Hey, Todeyya! 
          You have now become a dog for having spoken to' me and addressed me 
          with disrespect as; 'Bho, Bho, (Maung Gotama - Maung Gotama)' in your 
          former existence. If you now as a dog barked at me with a guilty mind, 
          you will relegate to <i>Avici</i> Hell." When the dog heard these words 
          of Buddha's admonition, it imagined as: "This monk Gotama knows what 
          has happened to me." Hence, feeling sorry for its own plight, the dog 
          went off (towards the back of the house) and lay down to sleep in the 
          ashes on the floor of the fireplace. The people in the house tried to 
          carry him up folding him in arms to be put on the fine couch he used 
          to roll and sleep, but in vain.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">On reaching back home from 
          his visit to the other place, Subha, the lad, asked, "Who has removed 
          the dog from its usual bed?" Members of his household told him that 
          no one had driven the dog from its bed, and then related to him all 
          what had happened. Being apprised of the incident which had taken place, 
          Subha, the young man, thought to himself, "Todeyya is my father. If 
          the monk Gotama had called the dog as Todeyya, it amounts to saying 
          that my father has been reborn as a dog, an animal. In fact, my father 
          has reached the Abode of Brahmas. What Ashin Gotama had said is nonsensical, 
          etc." He felt he was insulted. Being greatly outraged, he immediately 
          went out to see the Buddha with his malicious intention of making an 
          allegation against the Buddha for telling lies.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In this connection, the 
          belief that the young man Subha had had about his father as having reached 
          the Abode of Brahmas, was on the strength of his traditional concept 
          according to the religious doctrine of the Brahmana. Brahmins have a 
          belief that by practising in conformity with the doctrines of their 
          own religion, they would reach the World of Brahmas on their demise. 
          At one time, a Commander-in-Chief of the army by the name of General 
          Mahadatta, who had a firm belief in the Doctrine of Brahmana, had performed 
          a ritual involving an act of sacrificing the life of a victim to propitiate 
          a god called "Brahmanabhatta", spending a colossal amount of money in 
          the performance of rites. It was stated that a vision of hell as an 
          evil omen or sign (nimitta) had appeared to Mahadatta on the eve of 
          his death. On being asked by his Brahmana teachers what he had seen 
          or visualised, he replied having seen a bright lamp of brilliant red 
          colour <i>(lohitaghara). </i>Brahmana teachers had said it was Brahmaloka. 
          He then inquired where Brahmaloka was situated and whether it was in 
          the region high above, or in the lower region below. His teachers thereupon 
          answered that it was in the higher region above. He then said what he 
          had seen was in the region below. The teachers insisted that though 
          it might appear to be in the region down below, it was in fact in the 
          region high above. As he passed away while concentrating his mind fixed 
          on this sign <i>(nimitta), </i>he went down to hell. (Reference - Majjhimapanasa 
          Atthakatha, page 303) If a wrong religious concept has crept in, it 
          is really dangerous. In the present era, I have heard of people who 
          hold a firm belief that by slaughtering animals as sacrifice to propitiate 
          the gods, one would reach an abode of happy condition and that they 
          reminded a sick patient on his death-bed to reflect on the past incidents 
          recalling his acts of charity in slaughtering the beings. </font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">When the lad Subha met 
          the Buddha, he asked the Exalted One what He said to the dog on the 
          occasion of the Lord's visit to his house was true or not, with reference 
          to the information he had heard. Thereupon, Buddha replied that what 
          Subha had heard was exactly true and correct, and then, in order to 
          enable him to come to a right decision, put a question as "0, Subha, 
          the young man! Is it true that there are still a number of properties 
          which your father had failed to mention where they are kept?" Subha 
          then responded, "Yes, indeed. There are three in number - a gold necklace, 
          a pair of gold slippers and a gold vase worth one lakh each, and also 
          a lakh of cash, all totalling four lakhs in value. These are mentioned 
          in the list of properties bequeathed to me but cannot be found or traced 
          anywhere.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then Buddha ordered, "If 
          so, you better go back home now and on your arrival, feed the dog with 
          milk rice and other nice food, and, then ask the animal where these 
          missing properties are. This dog will reveal everything."</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">On hearing the words of 
          the Buddha, the lad Subha reflected, "If what Ashin Gotama has said 
          were true, the missing properties would be recovered. If his words were 
          found to be false, I will proceed to accuse him of telling falsehood." 
          He then returned home and carried out what was to be done as directed 
          by the Buddha. By the time the dog was dozing, Subha asked the animal: 
          "O, father, these properties (details of which were given) are found 
          in the list. Where are they? Ashin Gotama has told me that you know 
          where these are kept. Please show me where they are." The dog imagining: 
          "They have known all about me and I could not possibly hide the matter," 
          uttered a howl and then showed the place where the properties were hidden 
          by scratching with its forefeet the surface of the earth beneath which 
          the properties were buried. When they excavated the ground all those 
          four kinds of missing properties were discovered.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">As a result of this discovery, 
          faith in Buddha had arisen in the heart of Subha, the lad. He came to 
          realise that his father had undoubtedly become a dog after death. The 
          dog having revealed everything as stated by the Buddha, it had occurred 
          to him that Ashin Gotama really knew of the states of existence and 
          possessed the faculty of knowing all about the former, future, and present 
          existences. One would naturally have faith in what is stated if the 
          statement' so made is personally found to be true.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Those who have embraced 
          various kinds of religious doctrines, do not generally believe in what 
          has been testified by other different religious concepts contrary to 
          their own. This is of course quite natural. Some religions hold a view 
          that death of a human being is (in all cases) the annihilation of existence. 
          What it means to say is that there is only One Existence which terminates 
          with death. This concept, however, is not the product of one's own personal 
          knowledge. It is mere imagination emanated from one's own belief or 
          concept. In some other religions, it is stated that after passing away 
          from the human existence, a person will either go down to hell forever, 
          or elevate to the heavenly abode. According to what they say, these 
          are the only two kinds. There is probably no one who can vouch for it 
          through his own personal knowledge or realisation. This is a belief 
          which is traditionally handed down by their ancestors. Some religions 
          even say that after death, if favourable circumstances prevail, one 
          may be reborn as a human being, or as a Deva (nat), or as an animal, 
          etc. In this connection, there are some extraordinary individuals who 
          are said to have been endowed with the faculty of seeing and hearing, 
          etc., all that are taking place in the entire Universe, i.e. persons 
          possessing supernatural vision, hearing, and so on.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">According to the Buddha's 
          Dhamma, for so long as <i>tanha, </i>human passionate desire, is still 
          clinging and not yet freed, the process of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama will 
          </i>be going on continuously from one existence to another due to <i>kamma. 
          </i>In common parlance currently in use, it may be stated that a human 
          becomes a Deva, or a Deva becomes a human, or, a human is reborn as 
          an animal, etc., or an animal, etc., is reborn as a human being and 
          so on. In reality, it is merely the nature of phenomenal occurrence 
          of the continuing process of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama</i>. If <i>tanha, 
          </i>desirable passionate attachment, is totally eliminated through the 
          achievement of <i>Arahattaphala </i>by contemplating Vipassana, the 
          continuing process of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>will<i> </i>cease 
          to operate after the arising of <i>cuti </i>or death consciousness, 
          called Parinibbana. It is commonly known as entering into Parinibbana 
          - ultimate death, after which there is no more existence to come. It 
          is what has been stated by Buddha's Dhamma. This statement has been 
          fully vouched for by the Buddha Himself through his own perfect realisation 
          (Enlightenment) acquired through personal knowledge or Buddha's Wisdom. 
          Yogis who are presently meditating will surely stand witness to the 
          truth of this statement to the extent of their own achievement of the 
          insight knowledge.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The manner of how existences 
          have come into being is fully supported by the story of Todeyya, who 
          had become a dog. In the teachings of the Lord Buddha, there are numerous 
          instances of this nature which serve as evidence. In the present day 
          too, there are a number of such stories. One would undoubtedly believe 
          the story of Todeyya now narrated if one personally comes across such 
          incidents like Subha, the young man, provided that there is no prejudice 
          or preconceived notion. If one becomes prejudicial, it may invoke blind 
          criticisms for having entertained a bigoted view of his own faith. Some 
          might even set it aside as an absurdity saying that it was the deception 
          practised by Mara, the Evil One. If a person refused to believe what 
          the other has said through personal knowledge and experience, it becomes 
          obvious that he has become bias with his own preconceived ideas.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Subha, the lad, had no 
          such prejudice. He could give a definite decision the moment he had 
          personally seen and found the incident which was credible. Therefore, 
          he called on the Buddha for the second time to acquaint himself with 
          what he would like to know, and then, respectfully asked the Enlightened 
          One in the following manner.</font></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">These were the questions 
          put for clarification to know the cause of the inequalities that exist 
          in the World. Yes, all these points deserve consideration and reflection. 
          Some are brothers born of the same parents. There are even twins. From 
          the astrological point of view, they are born almost at the same time 
          with little or no difference in hour, minute or second. However, there 
          is unevenness in the quality of benefits derived by them individually. 
          There may be a world of difference between them in health, longevity, 
          in the accomplishment of attendants, wealth, prosperity, knowledge, 
          wisdom and education. If they are the creations of the Powerful Almighty 
          Being, there should have been no inequalities or disparity among humans 
          or beings. If there is any imbalance in the creation of mankind, it 
          needs serious reflection as to why they are so created. As such, the 
          questions raised by the young man Subha are proper, reasonable and sensible. 
          To these questions, Buddha gave the following answer in brief.</font></p>

          beings who deserved to be known), <i>kammassaka - </i>only<i> kamma 
          </i>is<i> </i>what they really own and possess.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">As regards beings, it has 
          been stated that <i>kamma </i>which they themselves have done, are the 
          property which they really own. Any kind of external property or belongings 
          such as gold and silver in one's possession that may be regarded as 
          one's personal property, if happened to reach the hands of others by 
          some reason or the other, will no longer be their own. Though, such 
          properties may be in one's own possession without destruction throughout 
          his lifetime, on his death, he will have to part with these. These properties 
          are no longer his own. However, in respect of all actions which he has 
          done or performed, whether these are business dealings relating to worldly 
          affairs, or acts of merits <i>(kusala) </i>such as <i>dana </i>and <i>sila, 
          </i>or acts of demerits <i>(akusala), </i>such as acts of killing <i>(panatipata) 
          </i>relating to the matter of religion <i>(Sasana), </i>these do not 
          concern others. He himself is responsible for these deeds or actions 
          which only concern him and is relevant to him. only. Efforts made by 
          him in matters relating to his business affairs will bring benefits 
          in commensurate with the strength of endeavour he has put in. Acts of 
          <i>kusala </i>also will bring him advantages as might be deserving, 
          throughout his existences. <i>Akusala </i>- Demeritorious acts will 
          in the same way bring forth bad results as a reaction. People in luxury 
          or in misery nowadays are merely the inheritors of their own good or 
          bad <i>kamma, </i>as the case may be. These have so happened not because 
          of blind chance but because of their past moral or immoral actions. 
          Hence, <i>kammassaka - only kamma is </i>their own property which they 
          really own and possess. This statement is, therefore, most relevant 
          to <i>upekkhabhavana.</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, <i>satta -</i> as<i>
</i>regards beings, <i>kammadayada - </i>their own actions or <i>kamma 
          </i>which they have done, are only inherited by them. It is something 
          which resembles sons and daughters who inherit the properties, good 
          or bad, of their parents. If a worldling performs his work which can 
          bring him wealth, he will derive due advantages thereof. In the same 
          way, if one commits a crime, he will receive due punishment for committing 
          the offence. Persons indulging in drinking liquor and gambling, will 
          have the disastrous effects of their own immoral actions. In the least, 
          it would adversely affect their health, their reputation, and cause 
          other miseries such as disharmony among friends, These are instances 
          of the disadvantages inherited by them. Similarly, acts of <i>kusala 
          </i>in the form of <i>dana </i>(charity) and <i>sila (</i>morality) 
          will bring them good results even in this present lifetime in the shape 
          of good health, long life, etc. All throughout the rounds of existences 
          in Samsara also, they will gain happiness relevant to the happy conditions 
          of life as either human beings or Devas. Eventually, they can gain the 
          bliss of Nibbana where all sufferings will cease. If acts of <i>akusala, 
          </i>such as, killing and stealing are committed, evil effects will react 
          to beat upon them even in the present existence. Moreover, throughout 
          <i>Samsara</i> they will suffer miseries or <i>Apaya</i>, etc. Good 
          and bad inheritance will be accordingly derived. This explanation as 
          stated has also been amplified in Anguttara Pancakanipata Abhinha-paccavekkhitabbathana 
          Sutta (66) in the following manner.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This word <i>"kammadayada" </i>and the 
          word <i>"kammas</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>saka</i>" have 
          the same meaning or effect. It simply imbibes the exposition of the 
          word <i>"kammassaka". </i>Thereafter, <i>satta </i>- beings, <i>kammayoni 
          - </i>are subjected only to <i>kamma </i>that has been committed by 
          them on their own volition which will bring the effects to all beings 
          for their actions to make them either happy or miserable. Ii means to 
          say that good actions mill bring them good, and evil actions will bring 
          them evil, inasmuch as every action produces an effect. This is also 
          an exposition of the meaning of the word <i>"kammassaka".</i></font></p>

          can be derived by depending upon them. If lacking in good relatives 
          and friends, no one can be relied upon. In much the same way, advantages 
          can be derived depending upon good actions or <i>kamma. </i>If good 
          <i>kamma is </i>lacking, there is nothing else to be relied upon. However, 
          if there is bad <i>kamma, </i>the waves of bad. effects will come rushing 
          in or bounce upon them like friends in disguise and enemies. This statement 
          also serves as a. clarification of the word <i>"kammassaka".</i></font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Kammappatissarana -

          of view, are those on which reliance can be made to bring 'prosperity. 
          Likewise, reliance will have to be made on acts of merit <i>(kusalakamma) 
          </i>to gain virtues. However, in the case of demerits, only by 'avoidance 
          of <i>akusala </i>or only if free from vices, reliance, could be made. 
          The more the demerits or <i>akusalakamma </i>can be cleared away, the 
          more misery can be minimised, or rather the less the sufferings become. 
          Hence, practices and performances of <i>kusalakamma </i>to dispel <i>akusalakamma,

          own individual <i>kamma </i>has made them happy and noble in the life 
          existence and brought them fame and honour. In other words, oneself 
          is responsible for ones own happiness and a man's misery is the consequential 
          effects of his own actions. It is his own destiny to be born noble or 
          ignoble. It is not that living beings expedience suffering and happiness 
          as a result of others creation or of the Almighty's creation. The Buddha's 
          Dhamma pins it down to one's own individual <i>kamma </i>and such being 
          the case, no one needs to be blamed. Let us recite the following motto:</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This is the answer to the 
          first question. "Killing others" means the destruction of the life of 
          any living being including all kinds of animals, which would embrace 
          even tiny creatures such as lice, ants, and ova and cysts of such creatures. 
          Some even die while being conceived in a mother's womb. Some are stillborn. 
          Some die within a month or two after birth or at a young age of ten, 
          twenty, or thirty, etc. Death which takes place before the expiry of 
          the normal life-span of existence without any unusual circumstances 
          under which living beings have gone through in the earlier part of their 
          lives, can be attributed to the consequential effect of <i>akusalakamma 
          </i>for having killed others in the past existence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Hence, a problematic question which 
          may arise as to "Why infants die immediately after birth?" can only 
          be </font><font face="Arial" size="2">satisfactorily answered according 
          to Buddha's Dhamma. At one time, Sayadaw Ashin Narada of Sri Lanka had 
          made mention in his teaching that the Doctrine of Creation cannot satisfactorily 
          deal with such a problematic question. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
          manner of his teaching may be stated thus: in every race or among any 
          living things and religionists, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">incidence 
          of death of an infant immediately following its birth, has occurred 
          or can be found. Such an incident is </font><font face="Arial" size="2">likely 
          to take place also among families who have by tradition adhered to the 
          Doctrine of Creation by the Almighty </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Supreme 
          Deity. It is difficult to solve a question as to why a person has been 
          created to die so, early in infancy. This </font><font face="Arial" size="2">infant 
          will not have committed any fault against his creator. As such, there 
          can hardly be any reason why the infant who is still innocent, should 
          be committed to hell forever. And also not having anything that can 
          be done by an infant </font><font face="Arial" size="2">according to 
          the wish of the creator, there is no good reason why he should be saved 
          to reach the heavenly, abode. Such being the case, the Doctrine of Creation 
          of Beings insofar as it concerns the death of young infants immediately 
          after birth, is obviously unsatisfactory." Moreover, preaching has been 
          done that misery which befalls the parents for the untimely death of 
          their child who is short-lived, is due to their participation and enjoyment 
          in the act of killing living beings committed by others in their past 
          existence.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In refraining from killing 
          the living beings - <i>panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami - 
          </i>an<i> </i>undertaking to observe the Rule of Conduct to abstain 
          from taking the life of other living beings will bring merits of <i>sila-kusala 
          </i>while this precept is still being observed without a lapse. Abstinence 
          from killing even when an occasion arises to commit an act of killing 
          bring <i>virati-kusala</i>. If One refrains from killing even though 
          this <i>virati </i>has not been originally observed, it is known as

        of Putigattatissa Thera</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the lifetime of the 
          Lord Buddha, there lived a Bhikkhu by the name of Putigattatissa Thera. 
          Originally, he was a layman from the City of Savatthi. After entering 
          the monkshood in the Buddha's Sasana, he was addressed as Tissa Thera. 
          Later, numerous acne or pimples about the size of a mustard seed appeared 
          on his body. These tumorous pimples gradually became bigger and bigger. 
          From about the size of a mustard seed, these pimples or boils had grown 
          bigger up to the size of bean seeds, and then eventually became swollen 
          to reach the size of a big round fruit (in Burmese "okshit" fruit - 
          about thrice larger than an orange) and then, burst or perforated. As 
          a result, the whole body was covered with numerous holes. Hence, he 
          was dubbed Putigatta - which means having a stinking body with a, foul 
          smell. He was therefore given the name of Putigattatissa Thera. Later, 
          the morbid growth of this tumorous disease had aggravated until his 
          bones were fractured. There was no one to nurse him. All his robes were 
          badly stained with pus and putrid blood. Even his own disciples had 
          abandoned him. Becoming helpless, he had to lie down all the time on 
          his bed.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">At that time, the Buddha 
          with his supernatural vision reflected and observed all over the Universe 
          as to who would be deserving of attaining special Dhamma, the Awakening 
          Consciousness. In His vision, the Buddha found Putigattatissa Thera 
          who would readily attain Arahatship. Realising that there was no one 
          except Him who could be relied upon by the Thera, Buddha made His way 
          to him as if He was making a round of inspection of the monasteries. 
          On reaching the place where Putigattatissa Thera was residing, Buddha 
          personally lifted up a big empty rice pot, washed it, and then, after 
          putting water into it, placed the pot on a hearth to boil the water. 
          When the water was about to boil, Buddha intending to remove the bedstead 
          (cot) where Putigattatissa Thera was lying, put his hands on the cot. 
          It is extremely wonderful and worthy of reference if we imagine Buddha's 
          Great Compassion and pity showered upon the Thera.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">At this juncture, other 
          Bhikkhus appeared on the scene and after respectfully entreating the 
          Buddha, "0, Lord, please make way. We shall carry the cot where you 
          wish to put it and lifted the cot and carried it to the kitchen where 
          the fireplace was standing. The Buddha, wishing to give the Thera a 
          hot bath, took the warm water with a cup and then slowly sprinkled it 
          on the body of the Thera. The Bhikkhus took off the robes worn by the 
          Thera, washed them with hot water, and then placed them in the sun to 
          dry. Buddha directed that Putigattatissa's body be properly washed and 
          cleansed with warm water. The Bhikkhus after complying with the directions 
          given by the Buddha, gave the dry robes to the Thera to be wrapped round 
          his waist in place of "Thin-paing" - a form of skirt which was taken 
          off and washed. When it had dried, it was again given to be replaced 
          round the waist of the Thera. The outer garment was then removed and 
          wrapped round the upper portion of the body. In those days, there was 
          scarcity of robes.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">There were no spare robes 
          to be worn. How reverting it was! For the eventual attainment of Arahatship 
          by Putigattatissa Thera, the Buddha has to act as a male-nurse. This 
          is really surprising, highly noble and respectful. Having been properly 
          attended to and nursed by the Buddha Himself, Putigattatissa Thera got 
          great relief.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Then the Compassionate 
          Buddha commenced teaching as follows:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">"Aciram vata'yam kayo,<br/>
            pathavim adhisessati.<br/>
            Chuddho apetavinnano niratthamva kalingaram."</font></i></p>
</blockquote>

          Putigattatissa! <i>Te -</i> of yours, <i>ayam kayo - </i>this body, 
          <i>aciram - </i>will soon,<i> vata - </i>truly<i> </i>and verily, <i>pathavim

          a corpse and then will be laid out naked to sleep on the burial ground); 
          <i>apetavinnano -- </i>for having become a dead body without consciousness, 
          <i>Chuddho. </i>- and since people concerned have abandoned it as a 
          mean and worthless waste matter, <i>pathavim adhisessati - it </i>will 
          come to rest on the burial ground of the cemetery. (What it means is) 
          <i>nirattham - </i>it<i> </i>is useless, <i>kalingaram eva - </i>like<i>
</i>a log, a lifeless and worthless stuff which will lie on the ground, 
          or rather, fall asleep (die).</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The gist of it is: "Just 
          as rotten and decayed logs will remain on the ground as have been discarded, 
          the material body <i>(khandha) </i>being lifeless will soon be abandoned 
          and left in the graveyard without any clothes on. In those days, it 
          was customary that corpses were thrown away in the graveyard without 
          burying them.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">After having heard the 
          teachings of the Lord Buddha delivered in the form of a verse, Putigattatissa 
          Thera became an Arahat; and not long afterwards, he entered into Parinibbana.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This Putigattatissa Thera 
          was a bird-hunter during the lifetime of Kassapa Buddha. He collected 
          and piled up the birds caught by him after breaking or splitting up 
          their feet and wings. Only on the next day, he used to sell them out. 
          Some of them were cooked for his own consumption. For having committed 
          this evil act of <i>akusalakamma, </i>his whole body became putrid with 
          the skin disease which caused tumorous growth of numerous pimples or 
          boils over the entire body. In that very existence, in coming across 
          an Arahat who was making a round for alms, he made offerings of a bird 
          curry and cooked rice, and then, for having prayed to attain <i>magga-phala, 
          </i>he had become an Arahat in this existence. This story of Putigattatissa 
          had convinced us that ill-treating others would cause disease. The motto 
          now coined for the purpose is: "He who ill-treats others becomes diseased." 
          If ill-treating is avoided, it will bring good health. The meaning of 
          this has been preached in brief in the following words:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2B)	<i>"Appabadhasamvattanika esa 
            manava patipada yadidam sattanam avihethakajatiko hoti."</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Manava - 0, </i>Subha, 
          the lad, <i>yadidam-yo ayam - </i>a<i> </i>certain person, <i>sattanam 
          - </i>to<i> </i>all beings, <i>avihethakajatiko - </i>has no intention 
          of causing harm and trouble, or rather, ill-treatment, <i>hoti - </i>it<i>
</i>is so. <i>Tassa - </i>That<i> </i>person, <i>esa patipada </i>- 
          for his good conduct of refraining from ill-treating or harming the 
          beings, <i>appabadhasamvattanika - </i>is<i> </i>likely to lessen the 
          diseases and bring about good health.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">In this connection, the 
          motto will hereafter be composed as: "Pity brings good health" This 
          expression would convey the sense that if refrained from ill-treating 
          others, it is likely to bring good health. If one has pity on others, 
          he will not be inclined to ill-treat them. The motto is therefore composed 
          as follows: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) "He who ill-treats become diseased, 
            whereas compassion brings good health."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Hence, a person who ill-treats 
          others will often be afflicted with many kinds of diseases. It should, 
          therefore, be noted that those who have caused ill-treatment to others 
          will be diseased. One who has sympathy or pity, refraining from ill-treating 
          others, will have less diseases and will be in robust health. This fact 
          should also be borne in mind. Let us now proceed to tackle the third 
          question, the answers to which will be rendered quoting a short phrase 
          in Pali.</font></p>

          of envy and a miser too. Every fortnight, he asked his relatives to 
          hold a meeting, and at every such meeting or gathering, he admonished 
          his son "MuIasiri" in this manner. "Don't think that forty crores worth 
          of property which we have in possession is a colossal amount. All of 
          these riches should only be acquired and accumulated. If a kyat is offered 
          repeatedly, the entire wealth will, in the course of time, be exhausted. 
          Hence,</font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">This verse <i>(gatha) </i>is<i>
</i>the same as the <i>Ovadagatha</i> given by Todeyya. The only discrepancy 
          between the two is the use of the expression <i>"upaciknam " </i>i.e., 
          of the white ants, and the word <i>"vammikanam " i</i>.e., the anthill. 
          In this regard, it is to be interpreted as <i>'upacikanam' </i>- by 
          the white ants, <i>sancayam - </i>the accumulation of particles of dust 
          which have been carried. Some time later, after giving his exhortation, 
          Ananda ' the rich passed away. He died without telling his son where 
          the five earthenware pots containing gold and silver were kept or buried. 
          After his death, he was conceived in the womb of a female beggar in 
          the village where beggars lived. This village comprised a thousand dwelling 
          houses. It was stated that from the time of the conception of this Ananda, 
          the former millionaire, in the mother's womb in his new existence, the 
          inhabitants of that village faced great hardship in the way of their 
          living or occupation. Circumstances under which they had to live became 
          uncongenial. <i>Neva bhatim labhati... </i>They did not receive wages 
          or alms as usual and were not able to maintain themselves. <i>Na yapanamattato 
          param bhattapindampi - </i>They<i> </i>were unable to obtain more food. 
          They received food just enough to support their own survival. As such, 
          the villagers wondered what were the circumstances that had shaped them 
          in that way. They thought there must be a wicked or evil person called 
          <i>kalakanni </i>(adversity personified) in their village. Considering 
          thus, they separated the village into two parts. Then villagers residing 
          in the part of the village where the mother of the reincarnated Ananda 
          the rich was living, remained in poverty and adversity as before. Therefore, 
          they again divided this portion of the village into two. It was repeatedly 
          done in the like manner until such time when the mother of Ananda was 
          left alone in a state of adversity. The mother, however, withstood the 
          misery with great patience. After giving birth to a child, she continued 
          to sustain herself for her own livelihood and the maintenance of the 
          child.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ultimately, when the child 
          grew up to an age capable of making his rounds begging for food, the 
          mother, no longer being able to endure the sufferings and hardship, 
          was compelled to abandon her son. A receptacle was given to him to seek 
          food on his own. While going round the village begging for food from 
          house to house, he came upon a dwelling place where he had lived in 
          his former existence. Having possessed the knowledge of <i>jatissara-nana</i>, 
          by which he had the faculty of remembering his former existence, he 
          entered the house through the front door. The sons of Mulasiri on seeing 
          him cried through fear. They got frightened at the sight of him simply 
          because of his extreme ugliness and ghostly appearance (his hands, feet, 
          ears and nose were horribly deformed). The disfigurement of his body 
          and repulsive complexion presented an awful sight.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">The children who were crying, 
          being the sons of Mulasiri, were no other than this unfortunate young 
          boy's (the reincarnated Anacondas) grandchildren. The baby-sitters 
          (nannies) who looked at him found the young boy (former Ananda) very 
          ugly. They then assaulted him with sticks saying, "You wicked devil! 
          Better go away." They then put him on a heap of garbage. As a matter 
          of fact they regarded him as dirt. At that time the Buddha accompanied 
          by the Venerable Ashin Ananda in the, course of their round for alms, 
          arrived at the scene. On being asked by the Venerable Ashin Ananda about 
          the incident, the Buddha told Ashin Ananda the state of affairs in detail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	Thereupon, the Venerable Ashin Ananda 
          requested the people near to bring Mulasiri to him. People in the neighbourhood, 
          who had come over to this place formed a big crowd. Buddha then asked 
          Mulasiri: "Do you know this child?" The reply given was, in the negative. 
          Buddha told Mulasiri that this child was his father Ananda, the rich 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Mulasiri exclaimed, I cannot believe 
          it Sir." Buddha therefore, ordered the child, "Hey', Ananda the rich! 
          You, better </font><font face="Arial" size="2">tell your son where the 
          five big earthen-ware pots containing gold and silver were kept and 
          buried in the earth." The </font><font face="Arial" size="2">place where 
          the pots were buried was shown by the boy, and on digging, all the treasures 
          were found intact. Only </font><font face="Arial" size="2">then, faith 
          and reverence had occurred in Mulasiri. He became a convert and observed 
          the Three Refuges the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Triple Gem 
          of Buddhism. On that very occasion, Buddha taught the following verse 
          <i>(gatha)</i>:</font></p>

          </i>- Having had this kind of assumption, <i>balo - </i>a<i> </i>fool

          - In connection with his children (sons and daughters) and his wealth 
          and riches.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">People are worrying with 
          great anxiety about their children's welfare and wealth under a false 
          notion that they, are really their own and always dependable. In the 
          event of the death of their own children -and the loss of wealth, they 
          would become anxious and greatly depressed with sorrow. They are worried 
          about what would happen to those properties and their own kim and kin. 
          There is no need to make a special mention about the physical and mental 
          sufferings which they are undergoing while the loss of their wealth 
          and the death of their relatives are taking place. They also become 
          wearisome for having to perform their work with utmost endeavour to 
          gain wealth that has not yet been acquired. It means to say they will 
          be constantly toiling and striving with worry and misery to bring up 
          their children. And yet...</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Atta </i>hi - Even on 
          his own self, <i>attano - </i>one<i> </i>has, <i>natthi </i>- no real 
          reliance (i.e. he himself does not belong to himself). It means to say 
          that on the verge of death, one cannot rely upon his own self. Even 
          after death, one cannot depend upon himself or help himself to avoid 
          descending to Apaya and to fall into a state of miserable conditions. 
          Hence, <i>putta </i>- how can sons and daughters, <i>kuto - </i>be<i>
</i>said to be really dependable? <i>Kuto danam </i>- how could one 
          say that he has his wealth to depend upon?</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Ananda, the millionaire, 
          whose story has just been narrated, had to undergo misery and sufferings 
          immediately after his death. He met with such sufferings for having 
          relied upon his son and riches instead of on meritorious acts of charity 
          <i>(dana). </i>There were a number of stories about people<b> </b>who 
          had become rich as a result of doing charity and offering gifts with 
          great generosity. A person by the name of Indaka from the City of Rajagaha 
          became a powerful Deva for having offered a mere spoonful of food with 
          great generosity to the Venerable Ashin Anuruddha Thera. This anecdote 
          has often been mentioned. Hence, the Dhamma: "Refraining from doing 
          charity causes extreme poverty; charity brings wealth and prosperity", 
          should always be borne in mind and well-understood.' After appreciating 
          as such, it is of paramount importance to practise <i>dana. </i>In any 
          case, Burmese Buddhists are not lacking in generosity and in the matter 
          of offering donations. They are generally accomplished with this quality 
          of charitableness.</font></p>

          prevail in one's life existence. It is sheer misery if one is short-lived, 
          disease, ugly, lacking in attendants, poor and lowborn. There is happiness 
          if one has long-life, good health, a fair complexion, many attendants,

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	Some people 
          do not know how to approach a knowledgeable person of experience, and 
          seek or ask for information or advice in matter which they are unable 
          to understand, or rather, of which they are ignorant. In accordance 
          with a Burmeses proverb which runs as. "Ask what is not known and cleanse 
          what is dirty" one should find out and ask what he does not know. However, 
          some people are taking things easy, and are complacent without trying 
          to inquire, and make themselves understand and become knowledge. Failure 
          to investigate what is not known is </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">n</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">egligence 
          or remission of one's own duty. In matters relating to, business affairs, 
          one, should inquire things which he is not acquainted with. If it needs 
          practical training, he should undergo training ' and study things properly. 
          Only then, can he find success in his business career. Much in the same 
          way, relating to religious affairs, one should ask and seek the knowledge 
          which he is lacking. It is, therefore, essential for him to ask what 
          is <i>kusala </i>and what is <i>akusala, </i>and so on. But a person 
          who has no interest in the pursuit of knowledge remain carefree and 
          nonchalant.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If one fails to 
          seek knowledge and the required information, he is not knowledgeable, 
          and is likely to do things which should not have been done. For having 
          done wrong, such an uninformed person, lacking in the practice of Dhamma, 
          is likely to land in hell (<i>Apaya</i>) after his death. If his rebirth 
          takes place in the human world, for having failed to equip himself with 
          the required knowledge and practical experience in <i>kusala dhamma, 
          </i>he is likely to become a, person of immoral character. This fact 
          has also been taught briefly as follows:</font></p>

          "Investigation brings high intelligence," is the motto now composed. 
          This may be uttered by incorporating it with the previous motto, as 
          follows:</font></p>
</font>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">(7) "Non-investigation 
            causes blind ignorance; investigation brings high intelligence."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font face="Arial" size="2">
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">	It means to 
          say that if investigation or inquiry is made one becomes highly intelligent 
          and wise. The manner of making an inquiry is by way of asking. "What 
          is <i>kusala </i>and what is <i>akusala?", </i>etc. <i>Kusala </i>is<i>
</i>a virtuous Dhamma. It is a faultless Dhamma which may be regarded 
          as <i>"anavajja". </i>If it is deserving of reliance, it should be resorted 
          to. If such </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>kusala-dhamma 
          </i>is<i> </i>performed, it would bring advantages and happiness both 
          in the present existence and also throughout all future existences in 
          the rounds of Samsara. <i>Akusala is </i>an evil Dhamma - immoral actions 
          rooted in greed, anger and delusion. It will bring evil effects, and 
          is a Dhamma not worthy of reliance. If such immoral actions were performed, 
          <i>akusala-dhamma will </i>have an effect of dragging him down to the 
          Apaya - hell, etc. Furthermore, it is bad Dhamma which produces evil 
          results - misery in the same lifetime, in the next life and in successive 
          births throughout Samsara. Hence, it - becomes essential to know the 
          distinguishing features between <i>kusala </i>and <i>akusala. </i>Those 
          listening to this teaching now generally have a good knowledge of most 
          of this Dhamma. However, the difference between <i>kusala </i>and <i>akusala 
          </i>Dhamma will have to be explained at least in an abbreviated form.</font></p>

          relating to these ten <i>duccaritas </i>may be referred to in the Sallekha 
          Sutta Dhamma, if desired. Putting it in a nutshell, all actions relating 
          to thought, word or speech, and deeds (physical) which cause misery 
          and sufferings to others are <i>akusala </i>that should be kept away

          <i>Sila</i> is avoidance of immoral acts, including verbal and physical 
          misconduct or behaviour. In fact, it is to avoid committing the three 
          <i>kya-duccaritas </i>and the four <i>vaci-duccaritas. Bhavana </i>is<i>

<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">Explanation has been given

          of the forty (40) kinds (modes) of <i>Samathakammatthana - </i>the<i>
</i>religious exercises in the practice of meditation, in order to make 
          himself clearly understood. However, also by listening attentively to 
          the teachings now being given or by perusing and reading the texts of 
          Dhamma with keen interest, it would serve the purpose. This is the way 
          to become wise and highly intelligent.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">What is more important 
          is to understand fully the <i>Vipassana-kusala. </i>It is necessary

          instructions on how to practise Vipassana meditation for the achievement<b>
</b>of <i>Vipassana-kusala. </i>If one is paying attention to the teaching 
          as at present, it would also be adequate for the purpose. This will 
          cause to bring about wisdom and good knowledge. Texts of Dhamma which 
          contain proper guidelines and instructions as to how Vipassana should 
          be contemplated in the right way will also go to serve the purpose of 
          acquiring the essential knowledge of the Dhamma. If one could arduously 
          practise Vipassana under instructions from the spiritual teacher before 
          and during the course of training, it would be the best. Although I

        manner of practising meditation to gain Vipassana-kusala</b></font>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2">At the present time, people 
          are being ridden with the evils of <i>akusala </i>such as greed, anger, 
          etc., based upon the sensations obviously arising from the six sense-doors 
          (<i>dvaras)</i> at every moment of seeing, hearing, contacting and knowing. 
          These have so happened for not truly realising the characteristics of 
          <i>anicca, </i>etc. - the natural phenomena that manifest at the moment 
          of seeing, etc. Hence, indulging in the practice of contemplating Vipassana 
          is to prevent any opportunity for the probable occurrence of <i>loba 
          </i>(greed), and so on. If the true characteristics of <i>anicca, dukkha 
          </i>and <i>anatta </i>are really known, the Dhamma that has been so 
          realised will deter <i>lobha, dosa, </i>etc., from arising. This deterrent 
          effect or the subduing of greed, anger, etc., is caused by the faculty 
          of <i>Vipassana-kusala - </i>merits<i> </i>derived from Vipassana meditation. 
          The realities of <i>rupa-nama </i>Dhamma are conspicuous only for a 
          very brief moment, as and when they occur. This is why contemplation 
          should be made while they are in the process of arising and becoming. 
          Only when contemplation is carried on at the moment of their arising, 
          the true nature of their characteristics can be known and realised. 
          I have composed a motto in brief in this regard. This is: "Real awareness 
          of the phenomena can take place only when contemplation is made at the 
          moment of their arising." This may be recited.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To cite an example: A flash of lightning 
          only occurs and is seen at the moment it flashes. Therefore, if desirous 
          of seeing the gleam of lightning, it must be observed while it flashes. 
          The brilliant light is not visible and noticeable after the flash has 
          vanished. Nor could it be seen by mere imagination before the electricity 
          is discharged to product a flash called lightning. The genuine <i>paramattha</i> 
          of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>is obvious only when it is in the process 
          of arising. When it has vanished after arising, it no longer exists. 
          Before it arises, it was not yet in existence. As such if it is contemplated 
          after dissolution, the reality or the truth cannot be known. Also before 
          it arises the truth cannot be known by contemplation or imagination. 
          Only when contemplated while it is occurring, it's true nature in its 
          originality can be realised. Only after knowing its phenomenal nature, 
          awareness comes as to how it begins to occur and how it dissolves instantaneously. 
          This is composed in a motto which may be recited:</font></p>
<blockquote>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>"Udaya" </i>means "arising" or "appearance". 
          <i>Vaya</i> means "dissolution" or "disappearance". Therefore, it is 
          usually stated as "arising and dissolution". When awareness becomes 
          sharp and active while contemplating the phenomenal nature of <i>rupa</i> 
          and <i>nama</i> at every moment of their arising and dissolution, the 
          real <i>paramattha</i> of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>will be clearly 
          perceived with insight-knowledge as to how they begin to occur and end 
          in dissolution. This cannot be perceived and known by merely uttering 
          as "arising and dissolving". Only when the truth is known, personal 
          knowledge and realisation of these <i>rupa</i> and <i>nama</i> are achieved, 
          in fact, they are impermanent, since they vanish immediately after arising. 
          This phenomenal occurrence is described in the form of a motto in brief:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Awareness of the nature of <i>anicca 
            </i>(impermanence) takes place only when "arising and dissolution" 
            is perceived by the sense."</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When <i>'anicca' is </i>seen and realised, 
          <i>'dukkha' </i>and <i>'anatta' </i>are known. Contemplation of the 
          phenomenal nature of<i> rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>with the characteristics 
          of <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and <i>anatta </i>is the genuine Vipassana 
          meditation. It is therefore essential to contemplate and note continuously 
          the arising phenomena of <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>at every moment 
          of "seeing", "hearing", "contacting" and "knowing", in order to 
          bring about the development of genuine Vipassana knowledge. Contemplating 
          and noting as such is to be regarded as practising Vipassana meditation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">How to contemplate may be explained as 
          follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is to contemplate and note as "seeing", 
          "seeing" when a sense-object is seen, quite similar to what has been 
          taught as: <i>Gacchanto va - </i>If walking, nay, while walking, <i>gacchamiti 
          - </i>as walking, <i>pajanati - </i>it<i> </i>is known or to be aware 
          of, etc. While walking, one is to become aware as "walking". When contemplating 
          and noting in the aforesaid manner, awareness of<i> </i>the true nature 
          of<i> rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>which are manifested at the moment of 
          seeing will take place. According to the text of Dhamma, the manifestations 
          of <i>rupas </i>and <i>namas </i>at the moment of seeing may be stated 
          as:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Cakkhunca paticca rupe ca uppajjati 
            cakkhuvinnanam tinnam sanghati phasso, phassa paccaya vedana.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Cakkhunca - </i>Upon<i> </i>the eye 
          also, <i>paticca - </i>depending<i>, rupe</i> <i>ca</i> - upon the visual 
          object also, <i>paticca - </i>depending,</font> <font face="Arial" size="2"><i>cakkhuvinnanam</i> 
          - eye-consciousness, uppajjati - arises or is produced. <i>Tinnam sanghati</i> 
          - The three factors - the eye, </font><font face="Arial" size="2">and 
          the knowing mind or consciousness the visual object having taken place 
          together or in coalition, <i>phasso</i>  sensation of touch, <i>phassa</i> 
          - has occurred. <i>Phassapaccaya - </i>Because of this contact, <i>vedana 
          </i>- feeling of sensation arises. Depending upon the clear eye and 
          the visual object, the eye-consciousness arises. Of course, seeing takes 
          place because of the presence of the eye-<i>rupa</i> and the sense object 
          of sight-<i>rupa</i>. As such, at the brief moment of seeing, the eye-<i>rupa</i> 
          is obviously present as also the sense - object-<i>rupa</i>, and the 
          eye-consciousness. An ordinary person without the knowledge of Vipassana 
          imagines that the thing that is seen or perceived is "I". When good 
          things are seen, joy and happiness take place. It is thought as being 
          good. Similarly, the eye and the whole body are considered as being 
          permanent and pleasurable as one's own "Self" and a living entity. The 
          object of sight is also thought of as being permanent, good and a living 
          entity, an <i>'atta' </i>This is how pleasurable attachment takes place 
          at the time of seeing a sense-object that has life. On the other hand, 
          when a lifeless sense-object is seen, an ordinary person will think 
          it as a material element or an object that is known by name or manifested 
          <i>(pannatti).</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A Yogi who is continuously meditating 
          (i.e. contemplating and noting), when his <i>samadhi</i> (concentration) 
          has become strong, every time he sees or hears he will notice distinguishably 
          that the <i>eye-rupa</i> and the material visual object are quite different 
          from his perception and the consciousness of the mind that contemplates. 
          Then the eye, eye-consciousness, the visual object and the awareness 
          which have occurred are all vanishing instantaneously after seeing has 
          taken place. They are, therefore, realised as being impermanent. Thus 
          they are considered as "misery" which cannot be relied upon and also 
          as "unpleasurable". They are also realised as merely a phenomenon which 
          is not an "atta or a "living entity". Those who are accomplished with 
          keen intellect will, in the same manner, know that what is seen and 
          what is considered to be a bad or a pleasurable sight are simply 'impermanent', 
          suffering and Non-Self.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This knowledge is the real Vipassana insight 
          - knowledge which realises and sees the truth through the characteristics 
          of <i>anicca</i>, etc., on and after contemplating and noting at every 
          moment of seeing. Hence, the expression "vipassana" has been expounded 
          in the commentaries as <i>"aniccadivasena" </i>according to the intention 
          conveyed by the usage of the words - <i>anicca</i>, etc., <i>vividhena 
          akarena</i> - and according to various forms or characteristics, <i>passatiti</i> 
          - for being able to contemplate and realise things, <i>Vipassana</i> 
          - it is known as "Vipassana". The manner of such a realisation in brief 
          is expressed in the following words. Please follow the recitation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"At the moment of seeing, the eye and 
          the visible object is <i>rupa</i> (matter) which does not know or rather 
          which has no feeling of the sensation. Seeing and knowing are nama (mind). 
          Consciousness or awareness through contemplation is also <i>nama</i>. 
          For having vanished and ceased altogether immediately after seeing and 
          knowing and becoming conscious through contemplation of what is happening, 
          it is evident that these are the nature of 'impermanence', 'suffering' 
          and 'Non-Self' (<i>anatta</i>).</font></p>

          not knowing what they truly are. Based upon this ignorance, miseries 
          and sufferings such as <i>sankhara-vinnana, etc</i>., occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">A Yogi who is contemplating and noting 
          as "smelling", "smelling" every time an odour is smelt, when the power 
          of his concentration becomes highly developed, will come to know distinguishably 
          that the nose and the odour (<i>rupas</i>) are different from the 'smell', 
          and that the consciousness of smelling is also another. They are known 
          as being different from one another. The nose, smelling, the odour, 
          and awareness through contemplation are found to have vanished and ceased 
          altogether after becoming aware of what has taken place. Hence, realisation 
          comes that these are by nature 'impermanent', 'suffering' and 'Non-Self' 
          <i>(anatta). </i>This is the genuine Vipassana insight-knowledge that

          it is being seen. Handling or holding the food, putting the food into 
          the mouth and chewing the food are only concerned with "contact" or 
          "touch" which is taking place. While chewing and eating, the tongue 
          that knows the flavour or feels the taste is 'awareness' of eating the 
          food. Every time the taste is known while eating, ordinary worldlings 
          are under the wrong impression that </font><font face="Arial" size="2">awareness 
          of the taste, the tongue-<i>rupa </i>and the taste itself are by nature

          that the tongue and the taste <i>(rupa) </i>are quite different from 
          his consciousness of the taste and the knowing mind. The tongue, consciousness 
          of the taste, the taste itself and awareness that occur vanish and cease

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> </b>The expression: "At the moment 
          of contact" (tactile) covers a very wide scope. What is seen can be 
          prevented </font><font face="Arial" size="2">from being seen by closing 
          the eyes. As regards "hearing", hearing can be prevented by going to 
          a place where the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">sound cannot be 
          heard. Consciousness that arises in smelling and eating may, of course, 
          occur only at times. However, in regard to "contact" and the sense of 
          touch (tactile), by bringing one's mind to be aware of the whole physical 
          body, the feeling of contact is obvious when contact is made with any 
          part of the body, or in other words, when the sensation of contact pervades 
          the entire body in any space whatsoever. Without bringing the mind into 
          the heart, or rather, without being conscious, there are things which 
          become automatically obvious of contact or touch. While sitting, the 
          feeling of touch in the lower portion of the body is conspicuous. The 
          contact of the body or any part thereof with clothes is also clearly 
          perceived by the senses. One feels and knows clearly the contact that 
          is taking place between the teeth and the tongue in the mouth. Flesh 
          and blood, etc., are also found to be always in touch with each other. 
          When walking or changing the posture, sense of touch in the bodily limbs 
          involved in manoeuvring is obvious. Every time breathing is done, the 
          movement of the air element, the propelling force of the movements and 
          touch are obvious in the nose and in the belly or abdomen. Also obvious 
          are the contacts which are caused by the conditions of heat and cold. 
          In connection with all such contacts and touch, the ordinary worldlings 
          think of themselves as their own "Self" They wrongly conceive that consciousness 
          of contacts is taking place always. When good and nice contacts or touch 
          are felt, they think of these as being delectable and good. These are 
          erroneous concepts viewing <i>anicca, dukkha </i>and <i>anatta </i>as 
          being <i>nicca, sukha </i>and <i>atta. </i>As such<i>, </i>these indicate 
          'ignorance' of the truth. Based upon this <i>avijja - ignorance, </i>miserable 
          conditions of <i>sankhara-vinnana, </i>etc., occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">	A Yogi should contemplate and note 
          such occurrences as "touching", "touching", or "contacting". In particular, 
          when walking, it must be continually contemplated and noted as: "walking", 
          "walking", or "stepping with the tight foot", or "stepping with the 
          left foot, or "lifting", or "stepping forward, or "dropping" and so 
          on. This is the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">way of contemplating 
          with awareness or mindfulness in accordance with the guidelines given 
          in the Mahasatipatthana Sutta as:<i>"Gacchanto va - </i>when<i> </i>walking, 
          nay, while walking, <i>gacchamiti pajanati - </i>one<i> </i>knows as 
          </font><font face="Arial" size="2">walking, etc." In this regard, the 
          manner in which consciousness or awareness arises by contemplating as 
          "knows as walking" - the three words as stated, needs special attention. 
          It should be known and understood as rupa-matter or form. No instructions 
          have been given to contemplate and to be aware of it as <i>"vayodhatu" 
          </i>conveying the sense of absolute truth or reality <i>(paramattha). 
          </i>Nevertheless, while even contemplating and noting as "walking", 
          etc., expressed in three words as earlier stated, a Yogi will know and 
          become aware of the pressure of stiffness and the pushing force which 
          signify the nature of movement or of the changing posture. Also, when 
          standing and so on, while contemplating and noting as "standing", "sitting", 
          "lying down", "bending", "stretching", "shaking", "changing", etc., 
          the true nature of <i>vayodhatu, </i>the element of motion or air element 
          will be truly known and realised.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next, when contemplating and noting as 
          "rising" and "falling", in line with the three expressive words of instruction, 
          at every moment of the arising and failing movements of the abdomen, 
          the true characteristics of the <i>vayodhatu </i>that propel and - cause 
          stiffness and motion will be vividly known. There is one peculiar feature 
          while contemplating the "rising and falling", that is, at the end of 
          the process of the rising movement of the abdomen, "failing" begins 
          to take place. In the same manner, when "falling" comes to an end, it 
          begins to. rise again. There is no interval or break in this process 
          of rising and falling as in the case of "sitting" or "contacting". Contemplating 
          and noting should be carried on as "falling" the moment "rising" has 
          ended, and <i>vice versa. </i>As continuous contemplation and noting 
          are made as such, mindfulness that occurs before and after the continuing 
          process, and concentration <i>(samadhi) </i>which occurs before and 
          after, being conjoined or closely knitted, and inasmuch as <i>samadhi 
          </i>is gained, <i>Vipassana-nana</i> - Insight-Knowledge will occur. 
          This is the peculiar feature in contemplating the natural phenomena 
          of "rising" and "falling" movements of the abdomen. However, it is not 
          that only "rising and falling" should be contemplated and noted. While 
          contemplation and noting is being carried on as "rising" and "falling", 
          imagination that occurs should also be noted as "imagining". "stiffness", 
          "hotness", "pain", if manifested, should also be contemplated and noted 
          as and when they occur. Any change in posture, if done, should not escape 
          notice by contemplation. "Hearing" and "seeing" which occur at the moment 
          need also be contemplated and noted. In the absence of anything in particular 
          which is to be contemplated and noted, it should be reverted to the 
          contemplation and noting of "rising" and "falling".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The propelling force, stiffness and other 
          physical movements that take place during contemplation and noting </font><font face="Arial" size="2">are 
          the nature of <i>vayodhatu. </i>Consciousness or awareness of the contact

          resides is <i>Myapasida - </i>organs of sense or the internal properties 
          of the body. At every time of contemplating and noting as "rising" and 
          "falling", stiffness or distention, or contraction, or propelling, or 
          motion, or sense of touch, or the objects of sense that are inherent 
          in the body, are clearly perceived. When the knowledge of concentration 
          <i>(samadhi) </i>becomes strong and stabilised, the form of rising, 
          awareness through contemplation, form of falling, and consciousness 
          that arises, are distinguishably known as being different from one another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hence, at the moment of the arising consciousness 
          of contact, it is distinguishably known that what is in contact with 
          the body is <i>rupa </i>whereas the sensation of contact and knowing 
          through contemplation are <i>nama. </i>Similarly, at the moment of walking 
          and taking a step, the bodily movement is <i>rupa, </i>and mere awareness 
          of contact and the consciousness that arises by contemplation is <i>nama. 
          </i>These are also known distinguishably. While bending or stretching, 
          the material body, the stiffness in the body and its movements are <i>rupa. 
          </i>Awareness and consciousness that occur are <i>nama. </i>These are 
          distinguishably known. In a brief moment of noting as "rising and falling", 
          the body itself, stiffness and movements which take place are <i>rupa. 
          </i>Awareness and consciousness of what is taking place is <i>nama. 
          </i>That is also distinguishably known. When the knowledge of concentration 
          <i>(samadhi-nana) </i>becomes highly developed, what is known and the 
          knowing mind have ceased and vanished altogether immediately after the 
          occurrence. Hence, these are truly known as the nature of "impermanence", 
          "suffering" and "Non-self" <i>(anatta). </i>This is the real spiritual 
          knowledge of insight <i>(Vipassana-nana) </i>which realises the truth 
          of the characteristics of <i>anicca, </i>etc. The following may be recited.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"At the moment of awareness of the contact,

        knowing</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Attachment to the thought or imagination 
          that arises is intense when one thinks highly of himself as one's own 
          self or a living entity. This imagination and the knowing mind are thought 
          of as being always permanent and ever lasting throughout the lifetime. 
          Imagination runs riot and action taken to devote to the work of planning 
          and imagining according to one's wish is considered as being good and 
          pleasurable. This is mere ignorance with an erroneous conception that 
          all such things are <i>nicca </i>(permanent), <i>sukha </i>and <i>atta. 
          </i>Also, based upon this false view (ignorance), miseries such as <i>sankhara-vinnana, 
          </i>etc., occur.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">To be able to dispel this ignorance <i>(avijja), 
          </i>contemplation and noting should be made every time imagination </font><font face="Arial" size="2">occurs 
          in the mind. While contemplating and noting as "rising", and "falling", 
          etc., if imagination creeps in, it must </font><font face="Arial" size="2">be 
          contemplated as "imagining" or "planning". This amounts to saying that 
          the arising consciousness of imagination and awareness should be contemplated 
          and noted. Every time such consciousness arises, it will be known and 
          realised that the body-<i>rupa</i> is one, imagining and knowing is 
          another and that consciousness is different from the other two. These 
          are distinguishably known as such. The sensation of imagination and 
          its awareness has the element of <i>rupa</i> (matter) as well as the 
          nature of <i>nama</i> (the mind) with its concomitants - the mental 
          formations. It has therefore <i>pannatti</i>, such as name and appearance. 
          Hence, this sensation which is known, cannot be said with certainty 
          as exactly rupa (matter). Moreover, the body-rupa, imagination that 
          knows, and awareness or consciousness gained through contemplation have 
          all vanished and ceased instantaneously after being noted. These are, 
          therefore, known as having the nature of impermanence", "suffering" 
          and "Non-self" (<i>anatta</i>). This is the genuine spiritual insight-knowledge 
          called <i>Vipassana-nana </i>which has the faculty of knowing the truth 
          of the characteristics of <i>anicca, </i>etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is <i>Vipassana-nana </i>which contemplates

          "May all beings be happy", while listening to the sermon. While contemplating 
          as such, what is brought to the mind and the willingness to recite is 
          <i>nama. </i>Recitation made and the sound produced is <i>rupa. </i>Awareness 
          through contemplation is also <i>nama. </i>These <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama 
          </i>have vanished and ceased while reciting with the conscious mind

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We shall now continue to recite how realisation

        given in the light of the present Kamma</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(2) If one does not care 
          for his own health without taking regular physical exercise and without 
          taking wholesome food which will give him nourishment, he may be afflicted 
          with health problems. Indulgence in sport activities and living on a 
          balanced diet avoiding food which is not health-giving are conducive 
          to good health. There is possibility of doing so only if he has no great 
          <i>akusala-kamma.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(4) [i]. Doing charity 
          or alms-giving, [ii] Gentleness in speech - speaking sweet words of 
          affection, [iii] Rendering assistance to others for their welfare, [iv] 
          Treating and befriending others as his equal, or rather, on equal footing. 
          These four kinds of noble conduct will bring about many attendants and 
          helpers in the present lifetime. These are the teachings of the Lord 
          Buddha, the Enlightened One. If these four <i>sankhara-dhamma </i>are 
          practised and fully accomplished, one is likely to have a large number 
          of attendants and numerous friends. If it is done to the contrary, one 
          will have few attendants and friends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(5) Practice that will lead to become opulent 
          has been explained in four kinds of accomplishments, namely the Four 
          <i>Sampada(s). </i>These are [i] <i>Utthanasampada. - </i>accomplishment 
          of manly vigour and perseverance i.e. to perform the work or duties 
          relating to his business or occupation with proper knowledge and experience, 
          and also with heart and soul, [ii] <i>Arakkhasampada - </i>to protect 
          his own property and wealth from destruction, [iii] <i>Kalyana-mattata 
          - </i>to have good friends and close acquaintances, [iv] <i>Samajivita</i> 
          - to live within one's own means, i.e. to be modest in the way of living 
          without being extravagant. By living in conformity with these Four Principles 
          of Conduct, one can become wealthy and opulent. If not fabulously rich, 
          he can be moderately wealthy. Contravention of these four principles 
          of conduct will surely make one poor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">(7) In regard to the, matter 
          of lacking in knowledge and attainment of high intellect, mention has 
          already been </font><font face="Arial" size="2">made earlier. (1) Cause 
          of short and long life in the present lifetime has been included to 
          some extent in the explanation given relating to the cause for poor 
          health and good health in number (2). As regards number (3), in the 
          matter of causing ugliness and handsomeness in the present life existence, 
          there is nothing much to be said. In regard to (6), low or high birth 
          in the present lifetime, there is hardly anything to be mentioned. However, 
          according to times or circumstances, if endeavour is made with the strength 
          of wealth, companions and friends, good intelligence and education, 
          with a view to earning respect, modest achievement can be realised within 
          the bounds of possibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As stated in the foregoing, all beings 
          are conditioned by their own actions of the past and present according 
          to circumstances; happiness, bad or good resultant effects will be brought 
          by their own <i>kamma, </i>immoral or moral. Good <i>kamma</i> will<i>
</i>produce good effect, and bad <i>kamma </i>will produce evil effect. 
          That is the law of <i>kamma </i>to which all being are subjected. It 
          is nobody's doing and cannot be repaired or avoided. Man himself is 
          responsible for his own misery or happiness. No one can create the conditions 
          of the life of a being, it is his own doing.</font>

          bad actions as their own personal property. Such actions may be mental 
          or verbal or physical, thoughts, words and deeds, done by themselves." 
          This has been accordingly taught by the Buddha. A motto has been composed 
          (recited earlier), and this may now be repeated:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"Doer of evil will gather evil,</font>
<br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Doer of good will reap good."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>"</i>It's<i> kamma, </i>the Planner,

</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After having heard this <i>desana, </i>Subha, 
          the lad, took his refuge in the Three Jewels of Buddhism, and became 
          a Buddhist. Relating to this <i>upekkha-bhavana, </i>the fundamental 
          point stressed is that misery, happiness, bad and good resultant effects 
          cannot be repaired, created or brought about by anyone. These have happened 
          according to one's own individual <i>kamma. </i>It is therefore required 
          of a noble person to remain indifferent to the pains and pleasures which 
          he may come across. No worry or spirit of goodwill need be borne or 
          exercised in favour of any other person wishing him to be wealthy, healthy, 
          and freed from misery and to be happy as before. If one is worried, 
          one will become tiresome for nothing. <i>Kammassaka - </i>Only<i> kamma 
          </i>is one's own personal property in possession. Therefore, one should 
          have a feeling of indifference to all beings who are either suffering 
          from misery or enjoying happiness etc. according to one's own kammic 
          circumstances. Let us now recite as follows in developing <i>"upekkha" 
          </i>with all mindfulness which will also include the manner of realisation 
          through contemplation and noting.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">"All beings have only <i>kamma </i>as 
            their own personal property in possession. Things are taking place 
            according to varying circumstances. This indifferent attitude and 
            willingness to recite are <i>nama. </i>Recitation and the sound (voice) 
            are <i>rupa. </i>Contemplation and noting them are <i>nama. </i>Only 
            <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama </i>are there. These <i>rupa </i>and <i>nama 
            </i>having vanished and ceased all at, once are merely the nature 
            of "impermanence", "suffering" and "Non-self' <i>(anatta).</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wealth and happiness are due to <i>kamma. 
          </i>Suffering and misery are also due to <i>kamma. </i>Only <i>kamma 
          </i>is<i> </i>one's own personal property. One has one's own <i>kamma 
          </i>which produces its effect. By developing <i>upekkha </i>with indifference 
          towards others, it could bring mental relief and happiness when misfortune, 
          misery or suffering take place. Bringing into one's own mind that everything 
          which happens is based upon <i>kamma </i>is<i> </i>not only faultless 
          or blameless, but also gives relief from mental distress even in the 
          present lifetime. For having avoided <i>akusala </i>and having developed 
          <i>kusala-kamma </i>.to the best of one's own ability to gain reliance 
          in future existences, one could expect to gain happiness and prosperity 
          in existences to come. If it is not practised in the said manner, anger 
          may arise because of misery which will thereby cause <i>akusala </i>in 
          finding fault with others when such miserable conditions occur. Hence, 
          the best course of action, is to make the doctrine of <i>kamma </i>a 
          part of our lives and to view things as happening according to one's 
          own <i>kamma (kammassaka) </i>and therefore beyond one's control. This 
          frame of mind will bring mental relief. It is pure and true, and the 
          best.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Explanation relating to the development 
          of <i>upekkha </i>has been fully rendered. We shall conclude this portion 
          of the Dhamma by reciting the mottoes relevant to the Teachings, which 
          run as: <i>"Kammassaka - </i>Only <i>kamma</i> is<i> </i>one's own personal

            their wealth and prosperity Which they have acquired, without diminution, 
            and may continue to be prosperous and happy as before."</font></p>
